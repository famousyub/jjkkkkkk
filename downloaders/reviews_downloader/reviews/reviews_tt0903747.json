I know the concept was superb as was the writing but Bryan Cranston made it all real. His performance, the creation of Walter White will be studied in the Acting classes of the future. He is the one that pulls you forward - as well as backwards and sideways - then I realized that his creation acquired the power that it acquired, in great part thanks to the extraordinary cast of supporting players. I could write a page for each one of them but I'm just going to mention Aaron Paul. I ended up loving him. I developed a visceral need to see him find a way out. Well, what can I tell you.

However, through a marvelous piece of editing and writing, the plot miraculously moves forward from that point. Bryon Cranston's idiosyncratic performance is a joy to behold. He embodies a man who is against a rock, and an even harder place, who has no other option but to throttle his higher aspirations and grimly carry on.

Over the last three weeks I have binge watched the entire series, averaging four episodes a day (unfortunately I have to work as well). What can I say about this series that hasn't already been said by other reviewers who are more grammatically articulate than I am. It easy to see why Breaking Bad won as many awards as it did. The writing is superb, not to mention the acting from its two main stars, Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul as Walt and Jesse. By the end of the last episode I felt my heart was broken. Like a break up in a relationship I would now have to get by without these two in my life. It's been an emotional rollercoaster of a ride but I enjoyed every minute of it. From Jesse's awkward moment having dinner with Walt and Sky, to Walt's maniacal laughter whilst under the floorboards of his house.\nSo to my friend I owe an apology.

It is also very good by Aaron Paul (Pinkman), Dean Norris (Hank), Betsy Brandt (Marie), RJ Mitte (Walt junior). Unfortunately, it feels like Anna Gunn (Skyler) is the weak link. It is hard to know if the Gilligan is trying to make a somewhat awkward and unlikable character, or if it is just not hitting the mark. I prefer to think that the writing is intentionally odd for Skyler for some reason, and that we will get to learn more in the episodes and seasons to come. The dialogue is absolutely brilliant for the most part \u2013 it almost always rings true. The episodes are gripping (for the most part). The story is brutal and comedic at the same time.

On the verge of his 50th birthday party. He begins having a mid life crisis, to make matters worse, he is diagnosed with terminal cancer. But not wanting to leave his family with nothing, in a quick way to make a lot of money. He teams up with a former student named Pinkmam(Aaron Paul) who is now a drug dealer, to make the drug called Crystal Meth. You don't like what Walter is doing, but at the same time you try to understand why he is doing it. I like watching the transformation he is going through, like Mr.Chips turning into Michael Douglas from Falling Down(1993). This series is quite enjoyable, it's a good dramatic series, with some humor moments. Cranstons performance in the show is memorable, and at times heartbreaken to watch.

A special mention to Dean Norris who plays Hank who is personally my favourite character in the whole show. The writing from season to season seems to get better and better in fact I believe there isn't a bad episode, the infamous \"Fly\" episode has a lot more to it that catches the eye. The show also has the greatest single piece of television I've ever seen in the episode titled \"Ozymandias\" which is linked to a poem about the rise and fall of someone in power which is also the greatest title for this 45 minute thrill ride of an episode. The show might have taken a lot of inspiration from The Sopranos but I feel as if Breaking Bad has a much more of a compelling and flowing story.

Gus is a perfect villain, who is so menacing while being so polite. Every role is perfectly acted. The show is full of insane plot twists that you'll never see coming.

Like many people I would like to lose this series from my memory to be able to enjoy again this television masterpiece that Vince Gilligan gave us and makes us feel as alive as Heisenberg was with his * baby blue *", "review_date": "19 July 2021", "rating_value": "10"}, {"reviewer_name": "cumhurbudak", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur134321157/", "data-review-id": "rw7116000", "short_review": "Amazing!", "full_review": "Will a better series come to the world?

So i actually lost my interest and then i scroll down the page and wholaah i saw breaking bad and i went on and check some reviews oh boyyy most of them were 10/10 and some of them were 9/10 and most of 9/10 guys theory was that they couldn not watch and enjoy another show after watching this. So i decided to give this a go and i downloadwd first two seasons and watched the first episode which was indeed funny and interesting and then moving on to next episodes and they were ok but still could not understand what te hell was that rreviewers talking about cuz it seems like an average show, no suspense at the end of an episode no curiosity what so ever. But i decided to give a go for the second season too and so glad that i did, from about halfway of the second season the climax began and oh boy even with the exams at work i could not stopped watching the show and one day i deleted the complete season 3 which i downloaded cause i knew that i am gonna screw my exams if i kept that im my phone. After the exams i immediately downloaded all seasons 3 4 5 and started to watch from the bebeginning and within a few weeks just finfinished the show and after finishing the final episode it felt like a part of me was gone and my life wont be the same.

It's not when we see sales skyrocket for a show. Not the Emmy awards. But when we watch a finale that does it the right way (sometimes, it works to do it the wrong way), and it leaves us speechless. It's not only that we are actually satisfied with this series finale, it leaves on that rare high note that other shows cannot seem to catch through their runs. They either stagger, or take a strange road. Only \"The Sopranos\" knew how to go down the ambiguous road, and it fit perfectly. \"Breaking Bad\" takes us from good to bad, and the journey is not a straight line. It zigs, it zags. It dings. it explodes. What we have here in the finale goes beyond the ambiguity and finds the spot in hell that each and every character deserves. All \"Breaking Bad\" has ever done is tick like a time-bomb, and all through \"Felina\" I could hear that ticking. It takes a second time to appreciate \"Felina\", and the whole series all-together, because its so dark and deep, the dig continues. Each season is a cakewalk compared to the next. It grows yet dies. \"The Sopranos\" gave us a playground of deep emotion and a ride into the subconscious. \"Breaking Bad\" gives us the results of the up and the down without cutting to black beforehand. It cuts right when it needs to, because this is an open and shut story. A story that weaves through all the predictable shows and gives us unbearable suspense, all due to the fact that it can be so unpredictable. It is beautiful, in the darkest of terms.

The USP of the show is its strong writing and execution. Kudos to Vince Gilligan for that. The way character of Walter White develops over the seasons from being a normal Chemistry Prof to Drug Lord at the end is commendable. The show creator have not provided any reset button for the protagonist to go back and being good, like in some other shows, which also makes this show unique. The protagonist has many flaws, still you will not have option but to love him because of its brilliant portrayal by Bryan Cranston. He has won 4 Emmys for playing Mr. White. The chemistry between Walter White and Jesse Pinkman played by Aaron Paul, who is beyond outstanding, is lit. The other supporting actors especially the ones who play Gus Fring, Saul Goodman, Hank Schrader and Skyler White respectively have done commendable job. Season 4 where we see the cat and mouse chase between Walter White and Gus Fring is brilliantly done. The last 3 episodes, especially the third last, of Final season are one of the finest you will ever see in television history.\nI have rated this show just for the sake of writing review.

Season 2 to 4 aren't bad by any metrics but if Season 2 to 4 were 9.5 out of 10, season 1 and 5 would be 9.8 and 9.9 respectively. Season 1 gets alot of flak for supposedly being too slow but I found the pacing to be absolutely perfect and it encapsuled the entire 'breaking bad' concept perfectly. The level of weight each action had in season 1 was unmatched compared to the other season (which is to be expected tbh) and man, then there's season 5. I finished it and was wondering to myself, does this season have remotely any flaws? I mean, yeah maybe alot of people didn't like the ending perhaps but I found it to be the perfect way to end. Besides, none of these are facts just my opinion so don't go all salty cuz I didn't consider your favourite show to be better than BB.

This is quite simply one of the best shows ever to hit the cable TV scene. I see it's currently rated #4 on IMDb's list of top rated television programs, and though one could argue that point, there's no denying it was a well written and incredibly involved program with a myriad of characters and situations spanning five seasons. I happened to binge watch it over the last couple of weeks, and to my thinking, I don't know how I would have had the patience to catch it during it's regular run waiting for each chapter to unfold. Thinking back on the series now, I don't know if I'd consider any of the characters as likable, though all of them are portrayed by an amazing cast of capable actors and actresses. RJ Mitte in particular, as Walter White Jr., is particularly impressive as a young man with cerebral palsy, a condition which he has in real life on a much milder scale. As the show's central character, Bryan Cranston arcs his personality from a mild mannered high school chemistry teacher into one of TV's most amoral and vicious characters ever. Without trying to dissect every single principal player, I can only recommend you sample the series for yourself. And what the final episode of the series does, which I thought I'd never see again in a movie, is memorialize the character of Lydia Rodart-Quayle (Laura Fraser), with the song 'Lydia, Oh Lydia', a tune I first encountered in the Marx Brothers movie \"At The Circus\", and once again in 1991's \"The Fisher King\" with Jeff Bridges and Robin Williams!

After what I though were a slow 3 first seasons and at times I struggled with episodes and the slowness of the whole program, the 4th and 5th seasons blew me away and once I had finished the series I realised why and how everything in this show had done what it had done. The cinematography is phenomenal, the way scenes are shot really does work with the show and improves what is already a great show. The acting is amazing from all the characters, the one of many things that impressed me with this how is the way your feelings for different cast members change over the seasons and you end up rooting for people that you never thought you would. There are some OMG moments and that happens when least expected and that increased my enjoyment of the show. Is this the best show I have ever watched?

I had heard about it, but I knew it was violent, and normally I'm very sensitive to that. But I digress. It's truly the most amazing show I've ever seen, and it's ruined regular TV for me. Amazing plot twists, some dark humor which I love, incredible cinematography, great cast, a good soundtrack, etc. Everyone on the show is awesome, of course, but Cranston is incredible.

This is NOT a show about drug and how to make it (although it seems that way), but to me, it's a show on \"how far are you willing to go to protect your family\"...and then, \"how far are you willing to go to lose your family\".

He is a character who has been a constant victim and who is also sentenced to a death sentence for an inoperable cancer. Therefore, realizing that he will soon die and his family will be ruined, he decides to team up with a former student, Jesse Pinkman, and start cooking methamphetamine. From that moment, Walter White begins his journey. However, and although at the beginning it seems to be, it is not a heroic journey, but rather the journey of a villain and like a man he breaks down to evil.\nAt the beginning of his journey, Walter convinces himself that everything he does and all his bad deeds are due to his family and for the good of it. But one of the greatest successes of this series is the way in which this man destroys himself to create an evil entity that is later called Heisenberg. This evolution or journey that the protagonist goes through is handled in a way that is as masterful as it is organic, which makes it not feel strange how Walter goes from mourning the murder of a criminal to having a chilling satisfaction for having murdered a drug trafficker boss.\nThis construction of the trip feels so fluid by small details that it paves the way to a complete transformacion. The total loss of humanity and utter fracture in the face of evil comes to a climax in one of the best scenes of the series. When Walter is threatened with his family by Gus, he goes desperately in search of money to rescue his family and escape with them. However, when he arrives at the place, his money is missing because his wife has given it to her ex-lover. It is here when Walter lets out a cry of despair and later a macabre laugh leaving the viewer stunned by such an act, the death of White and the absolute control of Heisenberg.\nWalter has followed a path that has led him to a very dark place. Although crime always pays in some way or another, and this is a reality in which it is probably the best episode of the entire series.. Ozymandias. Hank dies, Walter loses all the money he had made for his family and even worse, he loses his family itself. Now Walter is a person waiting for death and who has lost everything that mattered to him.\nThe final episode of the series is a poetic opera, where the protagonist is at the end of his journey and has nothing left but the consequences of his actions. But before saying goodbye it is worth a last look at a son, a last hug to a daughter and a last confession to the woman I love. In an act of sheer revenge, Walter ends up with those who robbed and murdered Hank, while saving Jesse, his former partner with whom he shares a soulful look that talks about a journey that has come to an end. And this is how Walter White finally dies and ends his journey, not of the hero, but of the villain.\n'Breaking Bad' is the subversion of the hero's journey, with completely masterful character development. But beyond that, it is a story that talks about morals, the path that decisions take and about life itself. A series so perfect that it will remain in the memory of generations as the pinnacle of cinematographic and television art, as a journey of no return that cannot be escaped and that the same spectator travels along with its protagonist.", "review_date": "19 August 2020", "rating_value": "10"}, {"reviewer_name": "nneelakandan", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur34159362/", "data-review-id": "rw6009146", "short_review": "Best one!

I heard the premise, and was VERY interested. A middle aged highschool chemistry teacher dying of cancer starts making and selling crystal meth to support his family before he dies. He finds a kinship, and partner of sorts, with a former student/slacker of his, Jesse Pinkman. The first season was cut short, coming in at only 7 episodes, but the second season has the full 12. Give this show a chance, its very addictive. Walter White is a character you want to root for, but sometimes find yourself asking how you can. The pacing of the story is brilliant, as is the creepy foreshadowing of the finale all throughout the 2nd season. This isn't a typical show, with typical character... we empathize and sympathize with Walter White, and hope that in the end there is a reason for all his madness. He starts out as nothing more than a nerdy, over-qualified chemistry teacher, but by the end of the first season, he has definitely grown accustomed to his alter ego \"Heisenberg\", the meth kingpin of New Mexico.

It holds a special place in my heart. It's kind of family. It is a very consistent show full of brilliant performances.

Secondly, character development, you know what I mean. The transformation of Walt into Heisenberg has to be one of the greatest character transformations. Every season we saw new sides of our favourite characters, some becoming bitter and dangerous and some trying to find the right path. This show introduced a villian (Gus) in the middle of the series and made him one of the greatest antagonists in television history. Every character arc ends with the show's finale, most dead and some living. The ending breaks you wide open, and makes you think, was it worth it ,Walt? Hank dies, Walt kills Mike , he lets Jane die, he forces Jesse to kill Gale, all for himself and money. Even when he gets money in a trust for his son, you are not sure if Junior will take it or not. The show has so many symbolic things, like when the villains die, Walt takes some qualities from them. He becomes violent like Tucco and calm like Gus. At least he didn't become a neo nazi.

The way they introduce the characters and shape them throughout 5 seasons is remarkable. The writing stays near perfect throughout the entire show, which is what put my closest contending show, Game of Thrones, at 2nd (those who have seen will know). There is never a dull moment or a moment where you feel like just bland dialogue or conversation isn't important to the plot. They take every aspect and detail in every area of the show and use it to the best capability. Along with great writing and top-notch acting (some of the best ever, including cinema) you get amazing scores and soundtracks which pull you in to the scene even more than you would think.

It aired in a time when watching TV shows was not my predilection in my spare time. However, it got my attention when it's popularity was at its peak. I understand now why it is considered the best drama TV series. The show has everything in the right place: gorgeous landscape shots, extenuating filming points of view, great soundtrack, excellent writing and splendid actors. The idea behind all of it is very well thought and the execution is magnificent. It is a story that shows that the line between what is good or bad is not very clear sometimes. Sometimes the ending justifies the means. Sometimes it does not. Differently from most shows, the main character is not the hero but the ultimate villain of everyone in that environment. The actors were flawless. Thank you for this show.

This is to say that, for a new viewer, the show may not seem like the era-defining show that it is described as being in the latter seasons.\nThis is only because the first season or two are dedicated to character building and world building, which acts as the foundation for all the incredible stuff that comes next. That's not to say the first few seasons aren't good. They're still great TV, but they're simply setup for the incredible seasons to come.\nMy words to a new viewer are: do not expect ground breaking TV from the very beginning, but watch until the end of season two, if you are not hooked by then, you may never be.

It's like a journey to watch this show. And the song in the end 'Baby blue' adds beauty to ending. Man seriously how can someone acts so well like Mr. Bryan Cranston. What touched me truly was that in the whole series Walter White kept on saying to Skyler that whatever he did, did it for family; but in the last episode he says whatever he did, did it for himself because he liked it. I mean you can think that a person who is going to be dead due to cancer, who is broken, who is hopeless, who is alive outside but dead inside, finds some reason to live the remaining time in meth making and eventually gets addicted to it. There are certain moments in which you (inspite of being the viewer and knowing that this is just a tv show) seriously want Mr. White to stop what he is doing and and be satisfied in whatever money he has aggregated.

This series is a masterpiece. It took me a while to get used to this kind of show, I remember watching seasons 1 and 2 and telling myself: \"is this what this show is all about? Two guys cooking meth?\". Once I arrived to season 3 and continued towards the end. I found this series to be a masterpiece created by the maker himself: Vince Gilligan. What I loved so much about the show was the transformation of Walter white to Eisenberg. Some say he became Eisenberg throughout the series but I believe he was always Eisenberg, it was just a matter of time before he reveals his true self. Let's think about it: once gus fring was dead, Walter was basically the new boss. He could have decided to let go of his gob and return to his normal life with his family but decided instead to keep with the work and continue being Eisenberg cause that who he really is. He is a ticking time bomb that waits to be exploded. Eisenberg was always in Walter and now he has taken full control and walt knows he likes being Eisenberg, he likes what he is doing. Bryan Cranston delivers his best performance ever, and a performance that makes him a Hollywood star. Aaron Paul is amazing, great emotional acting. The other actors were fantastic. Both Dean Norris and Giancarlo Esposito are legendary actors who have done amazing work with their characters. Season 5 was absolutely the best cause you get to see how everything collapses around the characters and how they are so vulnerable. So overall were talking about a fantastic series that over the years became a classic show that has many pop culture references and inspired so many with its creativity. And I'm sure it will be remembered for years to come, one day this show will be taught in cinema classes, it has much to offer: cinematography, production, art direction, set decoration and more...", "review_date": "3 June 2020", "rating_value": "9"}, {"reviewer_name": "rathc", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur119256779/", "data-review-id": "rw5793398", "short_review": "The Best Series on this Universe", "full_review": "", "review_date": "2 June 2020", "rating_value": "10"}, {"reviewer_name": "gavinf-36675", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur119254475/", "data-review-id": "rw5793169", "short_review": "Greatest TV show ever", "full_review": "It was definitely a 10/10 and here is why.

Breaking Bad is one of the few things on IMDb that I have rated a perfect 10/10 and here's why... Walter White's transformation from a low self esteem, overqualified chemistry high school teacher to the polar opposite of that spectrum as Heisenberg (no spoilers) is honestly extraordinary and fascinating to watch. Bryan Cranston's performance as Walter White/Heisenberg is the best performance ever put to screen and his costars (Aaron Paul, Anna Gunn and etc) are also exceptional and consistent and could not be played by anyone else. What I love about Breaking Bad so much is the subtleties in the writing and acting, the metaphors are so well done and the characters are rich with complex and interesting arcs. The whole show feels very consistent, with each scene having significant purpose to the plot and with each spoken line well thought out and meaningful. One of the best things about Breaking Bad is that you can put your faith in the creators, that you can trust that they know where to take the story and how to end characters' journeys, because they do deliver superbly on every case. The directing doesn't usually stand out (bar some of the best episodes/scenes) however the writing and dialogue between the characters absolutely makes up for this, it can be extremely sad then darkly comical but then incredibly shocking, all whilst retaining cohesiveness. It has great music which enhances the montages and shocking scenes to make them more memorable and iconic. Some of the story is not always memorable however this simply increases the rewatchability of it. The biggest complaint I hear about Breaking Bad is that the first few seasons are relatively slow and uneventful compared to the rest. But my argument is this: it's 'slow' because it needs to be, there isn't as much action because Walter White is still in the early stages of his transformation (and it also makes the few action scenes even more shocking and surprising by the time they do happen). This is not to say that the show's beginning is bad by any means it merely contains more character development and relationship building aspects that become important later in the show. However it does get better and more fast paced and action packed as the seasons progress. I don't see this as a flaw, in fact I see this as a necessity for such a deep character study. We need to see how his life was before it became what it did so that it can be hard hitting and intriguing when the change does happen. This transformation needs to happen slowly and subtly for it to be effective, so that you can't look back at a single point where Walter White became Hesienberg, you can only see how every episode he becomes more malicious and manipulative. It's great how every episode builds up to a climax, every season builds up to a climax, and the show as a whole is one big cresecendo towards the last few nauseatingly shocking (in my experience anyway) and immensely satisfying final episodes. Every episode delivers, in my opinion there is not one single 'bad' episode. To conclude, Breaking Bad made me laugh, it made me cry, made my stomach churn, it made me want to scream at my television, it made me literally nauseated with tension. It's subtle, nuanced, full of metaphors and hidden meanings with plot hints. The acting, story and writing is complex, intricate and some of the best the industry has to offer (kudos to Bryan Cranston, one of the greatest actors of our generation). I have rewatched this show many times over the years, and I will continue to do so. Breaking Bad is the only TV show I have ever seen that truly deserves a 10/10 rating. I cannot even find the smallest flaw that doesn't come down to just personal preference of the viewer. If I had to give one negative about this Breaking Bad, it's that it's quite draining and depressing once you have finished the last season, which doesn't detract from the quality of the show at all. I strongly recommend that you watch this, and know that I'll be jealous that you get to experience for the first time the rollercoaster ride that is Breaking Bad", "review_date": "22 January 2019", "rating_value": "10"}, {"reviewer_name": "cwycuff", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur46717653/", "data-review-id": "rw4228539", "short_review": "Great show", "full_review": "This show is written so well.

Many suggested I see it, but the idea to me was absurd to watch a mild mannered science teacher descend into the world of drug dealing, while having his soul wither away. Well, we can all be wrong, and this was a call I missed. What on earth about the above premise could make for good and entertaining television? Everything. The acting, the directing, the writing, and every damn thing associated with this phenomenal show. My husband and I watched this on a \"binge\", the first show we ever did this with. Aside from having to get up for work the next day, we would debate at four am.....\"well, one more\"? It draws you in, it hooks you, it makes you care. For the \"good\" guys, and the \"bad\" guys. Which, by the way, the lines between get very blurry. I'm waiting a year or so to watch in entirety again. I'm sure there is much I missed. And I'm not the only one I know who says they could not \"shake\" it when the show was over. I actually got a sense of depression! \"No Walter tonight\". \"No Jesse tonight\"! Whatever will I do!! In all my years of TV watching, I've never felt that. I even would occasionally relate to a character. Upon exiting my car one morning, someone almost came up on me quickly and cold have hit me. I had to BITE my tongue not to have the words \" Yo! Bitch.......\" fly out of my mouth. To finish, Breaking Bad was the most unlikely program I would every imagine I would consider to be hands down the best television show I have ever had the pleasure to watch. And I'm confident I'll enjoy as much, if not more, the second time around. One last note. Some reviews referenced the brilliant soundtrack --which it was. Being a 1960's music aficionado, I almost jumped at the screen when an exquisitely placed \"Crystal Blue Persuasion\" just came out of nowhere.

I have seen many TV shows in my life, but none are better than this masterpiece. Bryan Cranston gives the best, most realistic acting performance I have ever seen on screen. Not just Cranston, but all the actors in this show are great. Aaron Paul, as Jesse, is phenomenal. Dean Norris as Hank is also a phenomenal character in the show. The plot is also so perfect. High School Chemistry teacher dying of cancer, resorts to cooking methamphetamine to provide money for his family when he's gone. There is not a single flaw in this entire show... the acting is great, the casting is great, the plot is great, the episodes are extremely entertaining, and it will hook you right from the start. I give Breaking Bad a 10, but it deserves a 20. I have watched this whole show twice now, and already want to watch it again.

Comparison to any other contemporary TV series ( of any genre) seems simply unfair, that how much better BB is. 'Sopranos' comes close to it, except it was just new approach to old good mafia stories.

Breaking bad was just phenomenal .The direction and the plot was at the next level that no one other than Mr. Vince Gilligan can think of . Ever since i was born ,I have never seen a series which is binded with everything in one i e., the plot , the cast, the direction , even the bgm was soothing to the whole background of the plot.The foreshadowing parts was perfectly executed by the director . The whole crew is responsible for the huge success of this series and they certainly earned it. Till now there is no other series that exceeds 9.5 rating in IMDB.\nNow about this character walter white aka heisenberg is a selfish, cold blooded criminal . His villain ism and attitude was off the limits. At some extend of this play he even tried to kill a 7 year old for his own benefits and made other think that they were responsible for all these crap.His unconditional love towards meth business started to grow vigorously and turned him into a devil.Jesse Pinkman was the person who walter used like nothing and moreover he was the most affected for all the deadly deeds done by the selfish and cunning heisenberg.\nEach and everyone in this series acted as if it is real i e., Skyler White, Mike Ehrmantraut, Gustavo Fring, Walter White jr, Hank, Jane, Tuco,Marie,Saul, Skinny ,Badger,Steeve Gomez,Lydia,Hector Salamanca,Gale Boetticher etc and even those who played a teeny tiny role made the whole series mind blowing .

His science skills allow him to cook the purest methylamine in all of the state, and, working alongside former pupil and current fugitive Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul). He makes a colossal amount of money. Walter is driven by his new profession, subverting into a callous and brutal kingpin, creating distance between his family and himself. His occupation becomes known and leaves the character under increased pressure, life around him starts to crumble and his truths unfold slowly. The incredible hit series, winning a Golden Globe for Best Television Series in 2014, emphasises that sometimes we try too hard to do the right thing, Walter numerously states that everything he does is for his family - oblivious to the reality that he is putting them in danger; Vince Gilligan (director) mentioned that the show symbolises that \"all actions have consequences\".

I was emotionally overwhelmed to see all these events unfolding.Season 5 has to be one of the best seasons ever created and for me Walter White is the greatest character i have ever watched(i am yet to watch Tony Soprano so i could be wrong here) ,he has so much depth that just wowes you ,he can be a monster one moment and in the very next one he would be the hero.You hate him for being the evil he is but still dont want him to fail ,that's the magic the writers and creators have weaved in building him and it goes without saying the sheer brilliance with which Bryan Cranston had nailed this character ,in fact the entire cast is so good, the perfect ensemble. If shows like True detective which i loved in season 1 and Fargo which i also really like can be a 9 on IMDB then this without a doubt is a Sparkling 10 cause none of these come even close to its greatness.

The premise of the final season sees Walter & Jesse attempt to come up with a new way of building their empire to continue success. Bryan Cranston's performance as Walter White is easily one of the single greatest performances ever seen, he has so much depth to him and this season you really see the evolution of his character and how he has developed over this 5 season period and one that will be remembered for a very long time. Aaron Paul as Jesse is also amazing in his role, his character has had so much progress to him and so much character development. These two have brilliant chemistry in this show and really carry this show to one of the greatest of all time, the supporting cast is also great aswell. Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman is one of those great supporting characters, he has so much charisma and charm about him that dars you in and makes you want to like his character. Anna Gunn as Skyler White also does a really good job, her and Walter's relationship is really interesting to watch and you see how they have developed as a couple. Dean Norris as Hank in my opinion will go down as one of the greatest supporting characters in a show ever, seeing him finally try to work out what is going on is so engaging to watch and drives this season and some of the best moments of it. The story as mentioned is engaging to watch all the way through, the twists and turns that go in this season is great to watch, and I don't really want to talk about it as it is something you should experience yourself. The script is amazing the great mix of drama and humour really works and makes the characters feel really human and multi layered. The style is brutal and interesting to watch, seeing this man transition from where he was in the first episode to the last episode is amazing and something that needs to be seen.

The premise of the season sees Walter & Jesse trying to survive as they believe their boss Gus is trying to kill them. There isn't much more to be said about how amazing Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul are in this show as their respective characters but this season is the best work by both of them. Paul is really the main character this season and excells in adding layers to the character of Jesse Pinkman and Cranston nails the development of Walter and the change from the first episode of season 1 to the last episode of this season is absolutley huge. A huge shoutout has to go to Giancarlo Esposito who plays Gus, he is amazing in this show, he is one of the most deep and layered antagonists seen in any TV Show or film ever and is a truly memorable character. The characters of Saul, Mike and Skyler are also great this season and add to every scene that they are a part of. The story is excellent, to see how our protagonists have to deal with all these different scenarios is fascinating. I'm trying to be sparce of details so you can enjoy this great story for yourselves. The script is great, a real fantastic blend of humour and drama, the mix of likeability and intensity is there and easy to be seen which helps make complex characters. The style of the show is probably at it's most brutal this season and it highlights just how crazy the situation involving our characters has become.

At first, I actually thought of watching just the 1st season and continuing it in the summer but I ended up binging it in just 4 weeks when exams were going on. Such was it's fever. Firstly, BREAKING.BAD.IS.THE.BEST.SHOW.EVER. Nothing has ever been like it, and nothing will ever be. My love for BB cannot be described in words and I'm not exaggerating when I say that Breaking Bad is a part of me. Every character there is a part of my life. I'm a guy who easily gets influenced by fictional characters and Walter White aka Heisenberg, Jesse Pinkman, Saul and every character there has something you could take in your life. Breaking Bad's is one of the most iconic stories ever and there is not a better way to put it in screen than the way they did it. The script, character arc development, music, cinematography, screenplay, dialogues, art direction, and mainly the acting. Everything about this show is pure class. Some episodes are legit like adventure rides and I don't even know how people who were watching it when it aired waited a week and a year for every episode and season. I started watching it after I read someone comment, \"Not watching BB is a sin.\" and now I'm telling you, even 'that' is an understatement.

It relies solely on its characters, its story, and the deeply grounded reality it takes place in.\nNothing in this show is extravagant, or over-the-top, and it never relies on visual razzmatazz to attract audiences. Having said that, I have to give credit where credit is due, because this show has some of the best cinematography I've ever witnessed. Michael Slovis, Vince Gilligan, and all the directors attached to the show have labored to give us some truly jaw dropping shots, from the vast endless New Mexican deserts to time lapse shots of Albuquerque to POV shots of a fly.\nThen there's the acting, which is simply phenomenonal. A couple of episodes in, you'll completely forget that these are actors pretending to be fictional characters. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul in particular deliver some groundbreaking performances.\nThe story is also amazing. The writers always find new and unexpected ways to both subvert our expectations and reward them. Some of the best episodes in the series are \"One Minute,\" \"Ozymandias,\" and, \"Crazy Handful of Nothin'\". Not to say the others are bad; far from it. The lowest rated BB episode \"Fly\" is considered by those who support it as a work of art. If that doesn't convince you, I don't know what will.\nUltimately, the reason this show is so popular is because it always strived to outdo itself, without ever trying to jump the shark. It kept on getting better and better, and before the possibility of becoming mediocre had even reared its ugly head the showrunners ended the show, at its very peak. It never outstayed its welcome, it never disappointed, and it never made a narrative misstep.\nBB is the GOAT.", "review_date": "16 May 2019", "rating_value": "10"}, {"reviewer_name": "jmb-30435", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur61558383/", "data-review-id": "rw4856045", "short_review": "Tv serious of all time", "full_review": "Magnificent Best actor in all tv serious best ending ever on tv serious", "review_date": "15 May 2019", "rating_value": "10"}, {"reviewer_name": "sdhaked", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur66636738/", "data-review-id": "rw4839943", "short_review": "Wonderful piece of writing and epic dialogue delivery", "full_review": "One of the many things which keeps us interested is great dialogue delivery .

All of it for ego, entitlement & greed that is never satisfied, regardless of how many lives are destroyed in sacrifice to make few people rich, that are morally corrupt without any care for humanity.\nThe serial is exceptional in its depiction of the journey of one man, but what could have been highlighted in more detail is the impact it has upon the underbelly of the world that starves & scrapes for drugs instead of buying food or to be healthy.\nSensationalism of drugs is the last thing that we need in a country like USA where the Federally legalised drug manufacturers already rip-off the patients with overpriced medication; not to mention the opioid epidemic that they have created for their greed to be drug kingpins of the world.\nAlarmingly the corporations are in bed with the congress, the senate, the politicians that are elected to serve & protect their constituents, and they all have made a never ending web of exchanging money for power & power for money at the cost of millions in USA & around the world that suffer due to such deplorable deeds of people in public offices.

A crucial factor in its success is the fresh angle on an anti-hero who is the main character. As an audience, it is fascinating to watch the unearthing of Walter's true personality. The TV show is a modern Macbeth: we see a man overcome by power and lust for his true love; it is a modern Jekyll and Hyde. Jekyll is Walter and Hyde is Heisenberg, the one who knocks. What made this show so brilliant for me was the non-traditional approach to shaping the main character: we are so used to having characters that go from bad past to redemption to good (hero's journey plot line). And yet, this show is also a love story: the love of an idea, the thrill of feeling powerful, and feared. It is a story of adventure: a man hiding in the shadows of suburban life steps into the harsh sun light of the American Southwest Desert. Duality of man, in terms of evil and good, is brought into a distinct sublime spotlight, where \"good\" as society sees it is questioned. The theme of personal satisfaction is carefully strung out and analyzed as Skyler, Walter, and Jesse all confront their inner demons while battling outer ones.

What started off as the story of a man with cancer trying to get enough money to support his family after his death by selling crystal meth(which in itself is a crazy plot), it turned out to be so much more.

Without spoiling anything, the main character of this show, Walter White, has very little redeemable qualities by the end of the final season.

This gets the viewers feel his emotions and urgency of his cause. After this premise has been set in the pilot,thus starts the joy ride of Walter White's struggle from a chemistry teacher to the most prolific Crystal meth cook and drug agent/smuggler till the end. Its the character development of Walter White over due course that accounts for the name of the show,which means over time he gets socially good-bad-worse,i.e. he can go leaps and bounds without any restrictions and hesitations to do that suits him the best. The makers have done a good job with not complicating the plot with lots of FBI agents,cars,chases,surveillance strategies,fancy dialogue and good looking tanned actors with accomplished body.

Breaking Bad has been held as the best thing to ever be put on television, but is it. My answer is it certainly is up there, action, acting and particularly characters. First the acting, Bryan Cranston's Walter White is comparable to Daniel Day-Lewis' Christy Brown, Heath Ledger's Joker, Tom Hanks' Forrest Gump as well as other acting greats. Facial expression is enough let alone the intense delivery of his lines. Newcomer Aaron Paul is superb as Jesse Pinkman, the junkie/independent meth cook, early on you may not be convinced that Paul can act, but give him a chance as well as the show can take a few episodes as this show is the character study of Walter White and how in different ways he went from top to bottom and bottom top at the same time, Dean Norris, Anna Gunn, Bob Odenkirk, Jesse Plemons and Giancarlo Esposito are particularly brilliant supporting characters (notably Esposito's haunting Gus Fring). The writing on this show is ON. Always ties in earlier episodes and even seasons, never neglects characters (Badger and Skinny Pete). The show's directing is certainly film standard with top directors like Rian Johnson coming in for an episode or two (Season 3's \"Fly\" was excellently shot and one of my favourite directing talents in TV). Each season has its particular qualities, Season 1's comedy, 2's sudden drama, 3's action, 4's intensity and 5's intensity/comedy/action/drama. Season 5 was the strongest season by far as each of the 16 episodes were television art. Character development and wondering whether you love or hate Walter White are the show's biggest strengths, on top of the exquisite writing, Breaking Bad is one of the greats", "review_date": "14 December 2013", "rating_value": "10"}, {"reviewer_name": "yodelion", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur24403677/", "data-review-id": "rw2878475", "short_review": "Standout craftsmanship from premier to finale - doesn't miss a beat.", "full_review": "", "review_date": "30 September 2013", "rating_value": "10"}, {"reviewer_name": "rzajac", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur1517556/", "data-review-id": "rw2854626", "short_review": "All the good stuff of the best storytelling", "full_review": "", "review_date": "20 August 2013", "rating_value": "10"}, {"reviewer_name": "bebs1", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur24739235/", "data-review-id": "rw2674522", "short_review": "Highly addictive!

I had it with The Sopranos, then The Wire, and now with Breaking Bad. This is TV with quality as high as some of the best films made. The format allows time to really develop characters and get you involved with the complicated plot threads. No show would be any good without quality acting (this is a major issue I had with programmes like Lost), and the acting here is excellent. The casting director for this series deserves awards. All the emotions that the actors portray within their roles are completely believable, and engrossing. The writing is concise and intelligent; not afraid to be slow with its pace but always driving forwards, whilst still providing moments of exhilaration. The direction is smooth, concentrating on excellent cinematography to really get the look of a good quality film - and consistent throughout. What makes this series stand out most for me is that each season is different. It is not about recreating what has already been seen previous but concentrates more on changing situations and character relationships quite dramatically - and this is how it improves, with the fourth season being amongst the best Television seasons I have ever witnessed.

It took me months to finally came back to the reality, it was just absolutely perfect in every way , Vince Gilligan has a most creative and careful brain in the entire world, he can create something that you have never heard of or even think of and so unbelievably precision at the same time, the creativity is why this show was so good, because you will never know what is going to happened, even if you do, this show will still process in a most unexpected way, it won't just give you a scene that's full of mindless actions or gunfire, this is a show that will give you every single moment, and it could probably change a person's entire life.\nAnd by the way, Breaking Bad is never boring , if you think it's boring , it means that you are not paying attention.", "review_date": "12 September 2018", "rating_value": "10"}, {"reviewer_name": "sethsergent", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur85263813/", "data-review-id": "rw4321521", "short_review": "A true classic", "full_review": "Easily the best TV show i have ever watched!

I only really started watching it last March. By the end of the first episode I was interested and by the end of the first season I was addicted. I would watch 6 or 7 successive episodes and only stop cause I had to get some rest before work. Of course the story telling was perfect and the idea itself would make you ask what if this happened to me, wouldn't I become Walter White. A wrong turn you take under pressure, that you just can't undo. Then one lie will take you to the second and one mistake will take you to a crime. All the other factors needed to deliver the story just came optimum. Production, directing....etc. And then there was the acting, God were these guys really acting. Bryan Cranston was so real, he made the audience empathize with a drug dealer/murderer and actually wish he would win. I really didn't know Aaron Paul that much before Broken Bad, So I just believed that he actually IS Jessie Pinkman. It was really hard for me to see him in other projects because I couldn't believe he's the same person. Anna Gunn, Dean Norris, RJ Mitte were wonderful. But I have to say that despite there relatively small roles, Bob Odenkirk and Giancarlo Esposito took the show to that unmatched territory. I just want to say, if you enjoy the art of impersonation like me, and you didn't get the chance to watch this show please do so cause it will sure satisfy you.

The premise of a high-school science teacher who becomes a meth cook had its dramatic elements, but was primarily comic due to the sheer unlikelihood of the situation. As the audience to a drama, we want to identify with the characters, and we can't sympathize with a protagonist who acts without reason. We did have sympathy for Walter White as a cancer patient in a last-ditch effort to leave money for his family. We wanted him to succeed as a meth chef, and we are only willing to consider his moral dilemmas to the extent that we excused his crimes. Breaking Bad should have placed its protagonist in juxtaposing situations involving drug users, like the season-one relationship between Walter and Jesse. The show should have been about Walt considering the effect of his actions and his interactions with people who use drugs. Instead, the writer thought to make a cinematic crime drama, not the episodic, serio-comic look at a teacher, a man in mid-life, and an apparently upright citizen coming to terms with his hypocrisy and accepting others. In season one, Walt has contempt for Jesse, and we hope that this tense relationship continually resolves itself in camaraderie. Instead, the partners in crime hate each other more, and the conflict makes for a ridiculous spectacle as the series lays waste the best aspect of its first season. VInce Gilligan began with 'The Sopranos' before helming this project, and it is easy to see how a plot about the criminal mind of a high school science teacher was derived from the plot about the average suburban life of a mobster. In the latter, we sympathize with a criminal because we see a vulnerable life behind the goombah violence. In Breaking Bad, we lose sympathy with a vulnerable character becoming an egomaniacal criminal and ruining lives. In the Soprano house, there were few household secrets, and no insufferable moments of vile anti-drama when an audience hates the protagonist. The writers here should have allowed Walt to keep his secret throughout the series, which might have ended when his wife found out. Indeed, the initial story wasn't played out long enough. I find it almost unfathomable that five seasons of a show about making drugs might elapse without the main character even considering to try some. At most, the show could have revealed that Walter was associating with odd individuals and possibly using drugs. The series could have portrayed Walt's teenage son in admiration of Walt's young friends, or a wife who disapproved but was led toward consideration. A plausible familial drama would have been one in which a wife disapproves of her husband in a midlife crisis, condescending to youth. If that led to a divorce, the writers could have created ancillary drama about marriage and children. Anna Gunn would have played an estranged wife, not be wasted in the role of a domestic hostage. She fears for her children's safety, totally despises her husband, but never reports him to the police despite having every reason and opportunity to do so. One wishes that Bryan Cranston had found his character as insufferable as it became. This show was ruined by its early notoriety, and a writer encouraged to take himself too seriously. This is still TV, and the novel idea that Breaking Bad was TV art licensed the stupidity and boring suspense that ensued.", "review_date": "4 May 2012", "rating_value": "3"}, {"reviewer_name": "rachaelgrace-10273", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur74949806/", "data-review-id": "rw6006341", "short_review": "Boring", "full_review": "", "review_date": "18 August 2020", "rating_value": "4"}, {"reviewer_name": "billrabara", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur83564821/", "data-review-id": "rw6764453", "short_review": "GOAT", "full_review": "The greatest show ever made.

I totally disagree with the people saying it started out slow (some of my friends also said the same) I thought it started with a bang right away and you just knew there were gonna be twists and turns throughout the show. another thing I like was almost every character that I didn't really like at first, came around for me. For example Jesse, mike, and Saul. Skyler was prob my least favorite but she was still great at her role. However my favorite thing about the show is that 1) every episode, every season gets better. And 2) Walt just continued to blow me away (especially in the final season) by how smart he was and how he always seemed to have an answer or a plan for everything. It was like he knew it was gonna happen (of course it's a show but his character was portrayed as a very knowledgeable man). All in all, this show will go down in the books, at least for me it will.

Every time I rewatch this phenomenal series I always discover something new and pick up on things that I missed before. Each season only gets better and better. The characters are also amazing and complex. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul are the two standouts as they give the best performances that I have ever had the pleasure of witnessing on television. The on screen chemistry between these two actors is unreal. The Walt and Jesse relationship is the heart and soul of Breaking Bad.Anna Gunn,Dean Norris, Johnathan Banks, Giancarlo Esposito, Bob Odenkirk,Betsy Brant and RJ Mitte are also incredible on this show. Vince Gilligan your a genius. Thank you for giving us this outstanding work of art that will surely stand the test of time.

I would give it more than a 10/10 if I could because this show deserves that and so much more. Seriously, if you haven't seen it yet then WATCH IT NOW!!!!!

I was immediately hooked by the unique premise of this show. Mesmerised by the superb acting of the ensemble cast. The script has everything. Walter White, a normal science teacher, with a normal home life. Suddenly, his world is turned upside down at the discovery of having terminal cancer. He has poor health insurance, so how is he going to afford to foot the enormous treatment bill? What ensues is an unpredictable sequence of events. It is this unpredictability that makes this show compelling. Things really get interesting (and comedic) with the introduction of Saul Goodman and his resourceful ex-cop accomplice, Mike. I binge watched all 5 seasons within 2 weeks. Then, a year later, I did it all over again. That is the first time I've ever done that. Why? It's because this really is that good a show. I wanted to relive every moment of the superb acting. Watching that final episode was tear jerking...the end of the most compelling drama series I have ever had the fortune to watch.

Every character is relevant to the story and each character develops as the show continues. Just when you thought it couldn't get any better, the writers/producers throw in just a touch of comedy to break up the intensity, in the form of Saul Goodman. Pure brilliance. There is absolutely nothing that can be added or taken away to improve this show, as perfection cannot be improved on.

He could afford this because he's a successful drug manufacturer. At first he begins this dangerous career to make money to pay for cancer treatment. However somewhere along the way the writers began to lean away from the whole cancer issue. It seems to have disappeared as cases of terminal cancer so often do in reality. Along with the less than desirable vehicle Walt drives is his less than desirable harlot of a wife Skylar. This dried out old box has brought Walter down from one high after another during the course of this unfortunate program. Walt's one friend seems to be a meth addled degenerate wigger named Jesse. In short we have the tale of a guy with way too much money to have such a whore of a wife and a retarded best friend.

I know it has comparison's to Weeds, Dexter and Sopranos, but comparing BB to these shows, just doesn't do Breaking Bad true justice. The best word I can come up with is \"breathtaking\", and for so many reasons, the writing, the character development, the performances, even the production values... Vince Gilligan must be Shakespeare's and The Coen brothers love child, there can be no other explanation, the combination of pathos and inventive story telling is remarkable. Every character good or bad has true hidden depth, a true to life mixture of every emotion it's possible to convey, what is so unnerving is that we see through to the true humanity of every meth head, dealer, prostitute or street urchin, even the hungry 7 year old in the crack house in season two was 'perfect'... Cranston is remarkable because he stands head and shoulders above the rest, his ability to convey to us as his audience every emotion he is feeling, while keeping everyone - family - friend or foe, completely in the dark about his true intentions, is just flawless. 10 out of 10 is not a high enough score for this true American classic. I believe season 5 will be the last?

Hank the DEA guy is really annoying and I wish he would get killed off soon. The show has a few really riveting scenes the best being when Hank almost got killed by the 2 cartel guys...oh how i wish this fat dope would go away. I still can't believe Jesse just let the guy cold cock him in the face with no defensive measures whatsoever...come on writers! Anyway, there are many things about this show that are bad, but there are also some pretty cool things as well. There is nothing cool about drug dealing so please don't think there is. The show doesn't show much of the addicted side of the coin, some but not much. Oh, there was one scene when Jesse went to a couple of drug addicts house and to get his stolen money back...another dumb scenario with totally phony drugged out people and a little boy who was cute.

Breaking Bad driven by Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul, is some of the best television you will ever be able to find. From sitcoms in the 80's and 90's, to the terribly clich\u00e9d soap operas on today, this show is in another league of television. After being diagnosed with cancer, Walter White (Bryan Cranston) runs into an old student of his, and he gains the idea that if they cook and sell methamphetamine, he can make enough money to support his family long after he passes on (while trying to save his own life). I would not recommend this as a great television show, but as a six hour film. Each season seems like an overlong film, with great cinematography, perfect script-writing, and an electric performance by Brayn Cranston. It is arguably the best television show of all time, but I do not like to label.

But this character is not goofy or dimwitted. Walter White is your everyday man, who is a high school chemistry teacher, and has a loving wife and handicapped son. On the verge of his 50th birthday party. He begins having a mid life crisis, to make matters worse, he is diagnosed with terminal cancer. But not wanting to leave his family with nothing, in a quick way to make a lot of money. He teams up with a former student named Pinkmam(Aaron Paul) who is now a drug dealer, to make the drug called Crystal Meth. You don't like what Walter is doing, but at the same time you try to understand why he is doing it. I like watching the transformation he is going through, like Mr.Chips turning into Michael Douglas from Falling Down(1993). This series is quite enjoyable, it's a good dramatic series, with some humor moments. Cranstons performance in the show is memorable, and at times heartbreaking to watch. And he and Aaron Paul play off each other so well.

My opinion of the show was not always consistent through out. Initially I found the first season a bit difficult to get into and did not completely reach up to the hype that had been generated by everyone that suggested it to me. However, once I continued watching and reached season 3, I was hooked in ways that I have not been before. I found the character development to be extremely different than most of the other shows I have watched. Yes, I did find the plot and action thrilling, but the way in which the characters constantly battled the seduction of the darkness within them was most interesting. I am always used to finding some level of sympathy for characters, always looking for a rationalization to their actions good or bad. In the instance of Dexter, I began to accept who he was and his constant battle with himself and trying to find as balanced a morality as he could, allowed me to accept him. In the case of Walter White, after season 3 when he showed no sign of remorse for the child that had been murdered on the bike I was no longer able to find any justification for his actions. I was no longer able to sympathize with him, instead found him undeserving of any redemption or love for that matter. Being sucked into his own evil to that extent, and being at peace with it even at the last moment is no quality we look for in a hero. Although, as a viewer I was unable to love his character like a lot of other main characters, his story is one that will stand out. His character demonstrates the level at which circumstances can cause you to make a wrong choice. Initially, this choice was justifiable to a certain extent, but after a point it wasn't just about creating a better world for his family, it resulted in the surfacing of his inner evil and greed for power. Jesse on the other hand, was a character I could sympathize with. His constant struggle to right his wrong reflected some level of morality. There were some wrongs that were not justifiable and he was capable of acknowledging that unlike Walter, who would go to any limits to get what he wanted. Overall, Breaking Bad is definitely a show worth watching. It maintains a high degree of reality, keeps you on your edge with great acting; all of which are worthy of appreciation.", "review_date": "6 April 2014", "rating_value": "8"}, {"reviewer_name": "lnkhgthrb", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur36432344/", "data-review-id": "rw2857124", "short_review": "Highest viewer rating (TV or Movie) in IMDb...", "full_review": "...and for good reason! I am now done with the first season on DVD. If I had to describe this series in a single sentence, It would be: Abbott and Costello spend a \"Weekend at Bernie's\" in \"Fargo\". Without Walter's lung cancer and the gruesome crime aspects of the show, it would be totally worth watching as a situation comedy. Let's recap the main family characters: Walter could not be anymore square as the high school chem teacher until he learns of the cancer. Wife Skylar is a continually bewildered bystander...and pregnant. Teenage son Walt Jr. is handicapped (CP?) but for the most part he gets it. Sis-in-law Marie is a kleptomaniac married to Hank, who is some kinda DEA cop. So the prideful Walter must figure out how to pay for his cancer treatment. He is exposed to the idea of big bucks in cooking crystal meth through Hank's drug busts, and hooks up with Jesse, a loser, stoner, small time meth dealer and coincidentally a (bad) former student of Walter. And of course the brilliant chemist Walter is capable of cooking up the best crystal meth to ever hit the streets of Albuquerque, NM, so his talent becomes quickly recognized and valued in the \"biz\". From there, murder, mayhem and drug deals gone bad ensue and the series takes on the personality of the Coen Brothers' \"Fargo\".

Only to end up (with the exception of a few supporting characters), finding the entire thing anti-climatic and pretty dull. What made things worse was that everyone was going crazy for this guy Walt that I felt like a creature from another planet when I discovered that I absolutely, most definitely couldn't stand him. I despised everything about him. He had delusions of grandeur, but put no effort into making a success of himself, but was bitter and resentful of others who'd succeeded. He may have started out with good intentions when he got involved in the meth business, but eventually it's pretty obvious that he continues to do it in order to feed his bloated, narcissistic ego.Normally with a character like this, you find some trait that balances out the bad and eventually creates some kind of empathy.

Pitch-perfect story-telling with pitch-perfect acting. Not every episode is a masterpiece, but enough are to make the series a stunning television achievement and a must watch for anyone looking for quality programming. As the series explores the ups and downs of Bryan Cranston's everyman, and as circumstances force the everyman to spiral in and out of control, the viewer is caught up in the often compassionate and touching, and often horrifying and gut-wrenching situations and decisions he haphazardly or possibly in a state of panic, makes for a decidedly misguided (but wholly understandable) purpose. The love, the hate, the forgiveness, the revenge, the humor, the sadness, the loyalty, the betrayal, the goodness, and the evil, it's all there, and it's done to perfection.

Don't get me wrong, Breaking Bad is well directed and has some good acting; I can see why it is such a popular show. The dialogue is better than that of Dexter and about equal to The Game of Thrones. Maybe its just because the story line does not appeal to me whatsoever. Turning to selling drugs for money, even in tough times, is a sign of cowardice in my opinion. The money in the show does nothing for me; there are much easier and more ethical ways to make money. Find a passion, follow your dreams, and create your own future is what I believe in.

The side characters don't seem to have any personality whatsoever with the exception of Hank. Walter's wife and son are just walking stereotypes of the middle class suburban household but without any feelings. They get into superficial fights but there is no love or anything, no deep connection normal people tend to have with family or friends. This bland character writing is also evident with other figures like Fring or Marie. The same goes for Walter and Jesse. None of them really experiences any character development. Walter is an evil guy from the beginning, just hiding behind the curtain of a family man. Jesse, while a little less evil, seems strangely indifferent to everything and even when playing the role of a good guy for some time he solely drowns in self-sorrow, that's all. No empathy, no character change. There is no real personal struggle like normal people would experience and therefore I lost interest in their fate pretty quickly. Talking to your family like they are estranged relatives you just want to get rid of before turning into an equally unfeeling murderer doesn't count as character development.

The pilot is amazing and the episode I just watched \"Ozymandias\" is stunning. The show makes you feel emotions and really takes you into it, it makes a lot of people feel like they're actually experiencing what the characters are experiencing emotionally. The show is the most intense show I've ever seen and I've watched 'death note' and many other TV show's (Dexter, game of thrones, the x files, sons of anarchy etc); but Breaking bad beats them all. It is just incredible in so many ways, I love the way it makes me feel and it has elements of every emotion which I think is great, although the comedy is very dark, it is still comedy and I think it's great that they managed to fit that element in. I love how this is a show with a story line that has to end and I think that with it ending in the next 2 episodes, it is a wise decision and I'm glad the directors and writers have chosen to end it now as it show's that they are wanting this show to go out with a bang and it also show's they are wanting a good story line rather than a long lasting show for money.

It transcends all other dramas and all other shows of any category.\u00a0Watching the pilot is like reaching into a bag of potato chips and pulling out the first chip. It's delicious and tasty and you want to eat the whole bag.\u00a0 The main character is Walter White, an extremely overqualified high school chemistry teacher who has gone through most of his life without making any decisions for himself. He has a wife who loves him and a disabled son and his unconditional love for them is amazing. During his second job at a run down carwash, he passes out and is sent to the hospital where he finds out he has stage 4 inoperable lung cancer. Walt's reaction to this news is one of the most brilliant things I've seen. The doctor is explaining it to him and all Walt can think about is a mustard stain on the doctor's lab coat. It's the perfect metaphor for Walt's personality. The combination of cancer and everyone trampling all over him his whole life causes him to \"break bad\" and do what he needs in order to provide for his family, even if that includes cooking meth. Walt didn't just decide on meth out of the blue though. His brother in the DEA takes him to a meth lab bust where he runs into an old student, Jessie. Jessie is an underachieving punk who cooks and sells meth in his free time. Walt sees him as a business partner and it's the beginning of a beautiful and twisted friendship. Walt uses his chemistry expertise to cook the best meth anyone has seen\u00a0and Jessie helps him distribute. The struggles that Walt and Jessie go through keep you on the edge of your seat to the point where you fall off. All of the acting in the show is amazing. We instantly see ourselves in Walt and the whole point of the show is that none of us would do any different if we were him. I don't know how perfect writing, perfect acting, and perfect cinematography all came together in one show, but it's a perfect storm that will never happen again (and wont last forever due to the cancer eating away at Walt).

The photography of the sceneries, the time lapse in scenes are unique, as well is more than few times camera work in unusual way. The score tempo and sound of it brings tense and is in the great rhythm with the plot, all the way through series (especially season 4). Soundtrack here is less important, but the rhythm of the scores, which is unbeatable is creepy and unique. Everything looks more like high quality movie than TV show. Actors brings excellent acting, and are very involving. So much can be said, so much more, but in short, this is the one great TV show that is worth to have in own collection. What is interesting, the series did not fall down going through seasons, but becomes better. Fort me personally seasons 3, 4 & 5 looks the best.

This has been done before, but never have I related to a criminal like this. The story structure is completely solid and the progression always works to further the main plot. The writing from Vince Gilligan is phenomenal; I can't remember an episode of the series that I disliked. The story was always furthered in each episode. Aaron Paul and Bryan Cranston portrayed their roles flawlessly, I don't remember a second thinking something was unrealistic or cheesy from them. But while Cranston was entirely spectacular, I never felt the same connection with Walt that I always felt with Jesse. Aaron Paul absolutely blew me away with his performance, portraying Jesse Pinkman as a pitiful addict who you just want to comfort. Overall, this series has no flaws.

The fact that you could film 45ish minutes of television about trying to get rid of an insect and get people to watch it...amazing. Their lives must be pretty boring. Next thought: Did you actually film in New Mexico? Did you learn of it's history, it's culture, and past while you were there? Or was it just a place to film? One thing I didn't necessarily like was how Walter manipulated this boy, this kid into commuting murder and dissolving bodies and such. Still, did the boy have much of a future as a druggie? One positive thing that can be said, is they go out with a bang, quite literally. I think so much of the audience is captivated because it provides a darker alternative to their lives, perhaps stirring up feelings of what they might do or at least consider doing if they were in such a position. Indeed, I think some of the binge watchers even crave such a life.", "review_date": "2 December 2016", "rating_value": "9"}, {"reviewer_name": "gillies", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur0886454/", "data-review-id": "rw3105634", "short_review": "The show in 9 sentences ...", "full_review": "Dark comedy starring an Anti-Hero with a PhD in Chemistry who is the baddest dude on TV since Dr. Quest & Race Bannon put together.

After the episode in the first series where he is Nico's place (i think thats his name not sure)and blows it up with a meth look-a-like bomb, he starts to realize he gets a buzz from what he is doing and from there on he slowly develops into a man who you can hardly recognize as Walter wight.i do think the second series out of all of them was kinda weak in comparison to the others as Walter takes a break from dealing drugs and it focuses more on character development.Over all i think this TV show is incredible and Bryan Cranston's performance was truly amazing especially since this is the man from Malcolm in the middle. Aaron Paul was very good in this also and you get to see how Jesse slowly spirals down from confident to timid and you can see how the events of the series have effected him greatly.", "review_date": "20 August 2014", "rating_value": "9"}, {"reviewer_name": "aburbosh", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur101757759/", "data-review-id": "rw6523614", "short_review": "Too much", "full_review": "I think this TV is not deserved to be one of the best ever", "review_date": "24 January 2021", "rating_value": "2"}, {"reviewer_name": "kanegkellar", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur136994968/", "data-review-id": "rw7345483", "short_review": "A pure masterpiece", "full_review": "What can I say that hasn't been said.

It doesn't fall in the category of most of tv series, that are dragged on without a real plot as long and possible, and I absolutely love it is as long as it was intended to be. The images are amazing and truly art. The music is just wonderful and made me discover absolute masterpieces from all around the world that fits 100% with the movie, like the stunning Quimey Neuqu\u00e9n. I adore that all actors are comedians playing a more \"tragic\" role. The psychological development is crazy and the acting quality is one of the best I've ever seen. Another thing that I loved about the actors is that they actually look and behave like normal people. After BB I couldn't watch other movies or series without thinking how much they were too beautiful or too constructed to be people you'd actually meet in real life. At the beginning I wasn't convinced by the fact that BB is slow at times, but after some time I grew to love that because it helps to understand better the psychology of each character and because it's like how things develop in real life, sometimes slowly and sometimes fast. The only part I didn't appreciate was the end of Mike. Knowing the character, I don't think he would have let himself die like that.

I felt that the most powerful acting was done by Jesse Pinkman. His dialogues like,\" Hey, Yo! Mister White\" and \"B***h!\" will forever be etched in my mind. His relationship with Heisenberg, how he always felt that he was being used, like he was just a pawn, a means to an end is reinforced throughout the series, and when he finally gets out, the feeling is of liberation, in part quite literally. The relationship between the two is the high point of the series, how Walter considers him to be his son and goes to great lengths to protect him, time and again. His portrayal of transformation of a teacher to a drug lord is praiseworthy. As the series progressed his motivations are shown to change which is true for most people and hence is a very relatable character. The acting of his wife is also good, however I feel that time and again, she was shown in the wrong light. The series is made great by the acting of these three. Honorable mentions include Gus. The plot develops in such a way that the stakes increase every time. However, by the end of the season four you have a fairly good idea about what comes next. Even then the events play out in such a way that they keep you at the edge of your seat. Definitely one for the books, the highlights being the incredible acting and the relationship between Walter White and Jesse Pinkman.", "review_date": "20 July 2020", "rating_value": ""}, {"reviewer_name": "sashiv-rajiv", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur47188647/", "data-review-id": "rw5915463", "short_review": "Its AMAZING World Class...Cheers to best Actors Mr White, Gus and Jesse", "full_review": "I was not expecting it to be this good,I really enjoyed all episodes.

The main character was going to completely change over time. It accomplished this, and with some incredible television in the process. This show is so perfectly threaded all the way to the end and in this, to the absolute detail. In this show, you will see some of the best acting that has ever been exuded, particularly Bryan Cranston's performance of Walter White, which I regard as the greatest acting performance that I have ever witnessed, along with Heath Ledger's performance of the Joker in The Dark Knight. Giancarlo Espacito as Gustavo Fring and Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman do some sensational acting as well however. Pretty much every element of this show is levels above any other show from the acting, to the writing, to the cinematography, to the direction, and pretty much every element. The relationship between the two main characters Jesse Pinkman and Walter White is really the driving force of the brilliance in this show. The chemistry, no pun intended, between Aaron Paul and Bryan Cranston is truly incredible and a marvel to watch. The relationship between these two characters goes on such a rollercoaster in this show, and it's simply a marvelous thing to behold and experience. In the end, the two switch roles in a sense. Jesse Pinkman was somebody who found himself in this dangerous business but should not be in there in terms of who he truly is. Walter White is somebody who found himself as a chemistry teacher but should not be in there in terms of who he truly is. In the end, Jesse needed to get out of there and get away from the monster that his ex-teacher has become. It's truly an amazing thing to see, the radical changes that the characters go through. As Walt says in the first episode, chemistry is the study of change. And that's what this show is as well. Walter White, this seemingly-regular-chemistry-teacher-turned-wicked-druglord, is the greatest character I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing in a work of art. Bryan Cranston's performance allows us to see all of the nuances of his character and what goes on in his mind, and we see him transform before our eyes. The show has so many moments that will stun you, so many moments that will live on in pop culture long, long past the demise of this show, and so many moments that will make you marvel at the brilliance that you are witnessing. As intense and large scale as the show gets, it pretty much always stays in realism. That's one of the main factors that drives Breaking Bad apart from a lot of other shows. Whether comedy or serious, you can truly believe that this is what would happen next if this was reality- if this high school chemistry teacher really did become this murderer. The best fantastical and generally large-scale shows are the ones that are made realistically as we can engulf in ourselves in this world and crazy situation, and that is a joy. To feel like we're really experiencing something that's so insane and unusual. And that's the feeling that you get with this show. The writing crew let the characters drive the story rather than the writers. They didn't add the scenes that they wanted to happen; they added the scenes that they thought would happen. That's what drives Breaking Bad apart, and in this realism, we still end up with some of the most intense and incredible moments that have ever occurred in a show. This show really is as good as they say. I've never seen a better show, and I'm not sure I ever will. This is as close to perfection that I have ever seen a show reach. Vince Gilligan is a genius, and I thank him and the rest of the cast and crew for this beautifully twisted masterpiece of art.", "review_date": "18 October 2019", "rating_value": ""}, {"reviewer_name": "jackbrown-44221", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur83950629/", "data-review-id": "rw5182990", "short_review": "A m a z i n g", "full_review": "So, for the past 2-3 years a series I've fell in love with and dedicated watching, has been Breaking Bad due to word of mouth recommendations. The whole series was out-gloriously-standing and Vince Gilligan added a great deal of twists and turns within the story over 5 seasons to keep me gripped in the storyline. The ensemble casting has added to the depth of the story combined with amazing effects, videography, photography and in turn amazing characters etc. All of which making this series a master piece to watch and very, very pleasing to watch exploiting an unexplored market which undoubtedly contributed to this success. Lastly, watching the 5x16 finale just there, has meant that I can leap into El Camino and follow the story further, with confident eyes/ a clean mind and just enjoy what happens more.", "review_date": "12 October 2019", "rating_value": "10"}]}, {"ImdbId": "tt0903747", "reviews": [{"reviewer_name": "salinaqvi", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur108662740/", "data-review-id": "rw5179674", "short_review": "What is there left that needs to be said", "full_review": "There is nothing to say that has not been said repeatedly over and over again.

The premise of the season sees Walter cooking Meth for a buisnessman and Jesse in rehab as a pair of assasins hunt down the man known as Heisenberg. Bryan Cranston is amazing as Walter White, he is intense, charismatic and I haven't cared about a character more then Walter in this season of the show. There isn't much more to say except that this is one of the best written characters to have ever existed on TV or Film. Aaron Paul also gives a brilliant perfromance as Jesse Pinkerman, you truly care about his character this season and he delivers some excellent dramatic acting, their chemistry this season oozes off the screen and builds an amazing partnership. Dean Norris as Hank is one of my favourite characters on this show and this season his character is given fantastic development and becomes so much more then a loud comedic character. Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman is one of those characters who is so charismatic that you can't help but keep your eyes glued upon him even amongst Cranston and Paul. Giancarlo Esposito plays Gus, and he is a great change of pace as a drug lord showing a more calm composure that has a very good relationship with Walter White. The stroy of the season twists and turns throughout and unlike the last two seasons it kept me engrossed throughout and I was surprised just how many twists the season takes in a positive way to keep me guessing. The script is fantastic with some amazing dramatic moments mixed with an appropriate use of humour to make this over the top situation feel very real and human. The style is more suspensful this season and it really did a great job of making you care about the situation and the characters.

Bryan Cranston relaunched his career in the role of Walter White and he is absolutley amazing in this show, he has so much acting ability it is scary. You will care about Walter and his plight and even though he is doing bad things you totally understand why he is doing it. Aaron Paul plays his partner Jesse Pinkman and he is fantastic as well, their chemistry together is off the charts and it is so entertaining to watch these two work together. The rest of the cast all do a great job, I really liked the character of Hank who is Walter's brother in law and happens to be a DEA agent hunting him down. All the family were entertaining and all the drug dealers provided some extra quality to the show. The story is great, showing the lengths that this average guy will go too make sure his family is okay and seeing how he adapts to this situation. However, this season is a bit open ended and ends quite abruptly. The script is great, it has amazing drama in it with some real intense acting and the humour when it is used really does work and adds extra layers to these characters.

And the ride I was in for. Vince Gilligan's masterpiece combines dark humor, massively thrilling plot twists, emotional weight, and superb acting. The result? The closest thing to perfection I've ever witnessed, films included. The character development of the \"Breaking Bad\" is out of this world, and that's not the case for Walter White - played flawlessly by Bryan Cranston - only. The individual arcs for each character, Aaron Paul's Jesse Pinkman, Anna Gunn's Skylar White, Bob Odenkirk's Saul Goodman, Dean Norris' Hank Schrader, you name it, are so fleshed out with no details left out. And the series' use of allegory, minimalistic symbolism, and themes never fall in any cliche traps, instead adding to the show's unique atmosphere, making it the best thing ever produced.

And I will definitely come back to it after some time again!\nThe story is not just catchy and extremely interesting with every episode, but also completely thought through. Every decision that the characters do or decisions they make, will definitely have consequences later on, I mean nothing happens without a reason - it is perfectly written. The outstanding transformation of the main character Walter White to Heisenberg during 5 seasons is just brilliant. Your opinion on this character (and not just him) may change with every couple of episodes. You sympathize with Walt in the beginning and can understand his motivations, but later on, when he develops into a literal monster, you just feel disgusted with him. After seeing how he cares for his family, and even Hank and Jesse, whom both turned on him (and both probably with a good reason), and he still tries to save both of them, you just start to feel a bit sympathy for him again. At the end when everyone abandons him and he atones himself, I just couldn't hold my emotions. Just felt very sorry for him again.\nAll of the actors played their roles marvelously and music choices were perfect and always fit the mood at the screen.\nBeside all of that, this show is very credible and mostly reflects real life - Vince Gilligan just made a perfect reflection of how difficult it gets when you're looking for \"the easy way of getting money\". So much suffering, violence, uncertainty, fear for life, loss of close ones and unexpected circumstances around you. How frustrating it is, until you actually achieve something, in this \"profession\".\nI personally loved that Walt's former intention (until he became Heisenberg) to sustain his family after his death and leave some money, escalates in the worst possible ending - he looses his family - because of his own choices and he must endure the repercussions alone.\nMy personal absolute favorite show so far, definitely a must watch :)", "review_date": "20 June 2019", "rating_value": "10"}, {"reviewer_name": "thisisspartacus-51825", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur104578424/", "data-review-id": "rw4946187", "short_review": "Breaking Bad is too good to miss out on.", "full_review": "Breaking bad has some of the best characters in tv history, a unique and exciting story, and amazing acting that all go together to create this memorable and fantastic show that you should watch immediately.", "review_date": "19 June 2019", "rating_value": "9"}, {"reviewer_name": "furkanbozdag-11632", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur89041120/", "data-review-id": "rw4922688", "short_review": "Addicted", "full_review": "I heard from many people that it was a amazing serie but i did not watched it at first till watchmojo uploaded a video with as subject top 10 worst things walter white has done with in a couple of days i finished watching it season 1 was a bit boring but after that it got perfect my order for all season\n1. season 2\n2. season 4\n3. season 5\n4 season 3\n5 season 1", "review_date": "8 June 2019", "rating_value": "10"}, {"reviewer_name": "iamwarrenclark", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur101930457/", "data-review-id": "rw4920685", "short_review": "LACK OF SEASONS!", "full_review": "", "review_date": "8 June 2019", "rating_value": "10"}]}, {"ImdbId": "tt0903747", "reviews": [{"reviewer_name": "crocker-08944", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur71074590/", "data-review-id": "rw4919029", "short_review": "The best TV show i've ever seen", "full_review": "The best TV show i've ever seen by far!\nEvery episode was something special for me.", "review_date": "7 June 2019", "rating_value": "10"}, {"reviewer_name": "yalmasoud", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur82159377/", "data-review-id": "rw4918507", "short_review": "Breaking bad", "full_review": "A great show will not repeate a great story from a teacher to a drug cook into a person who ended up his life because of his family who wanted to protect her, thank you, Brian, for all she gave you great", "review_date": "7 June 2019", "rating_value": "10"}, {"reviewer_name": "biljakob", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur102873841/", "data-review-id": "rw4911206", "short_review": "Best series ever", "full_review": "I love it so Much.

But this character is not goofy or dimwitted. Walter White is your everyday man, who is a high school chemistry teacher, and has a loving wife and handicapped son. On the verge of his 50th birthday party. He begins having a mid life crisis, to make matters worse, he is diagnosed with terminal cancer. But not wanting to leave his family with nothing, in a quick way to make a lot of money. He teams up with a former student named Pinkmam(Aaron Paul) who is now a drug dealer, to make the drug called Crystal Meth. You don't like what Walter is doing, but at the same time you try to understand why he is doing it. I like watching the transformation he is going through, like Mr.Chips turning into Michael Douglas from Falling Down(1993). This series is quite enjoyable, it's a good dramatic series, with some humor moments. Cranstons performance in the show is memorable, and at times heartbroken to watch. And he and Aaron Paul play off each other so well.

First of all, how can anyone possibly think this show has great writing!? I have to admit that the first season had promise and I thought it could and should get better with the second season, but it turned out I was way off. Every single character is a stereotype! I'll start with the \"bad guys\". Tuco and his cousins? What is that!? Tuco's acting and actions are way over the top to be anywhere close to being believable. As for his cousins.. every time they came on screen, I just wanted to laugh out loud with how ridiculous and cheesy they were(lol at the dragging the axe scenes straight out of a horror B-movie). Gus anyone? Another way over the top stereotype of a business-man/gangster character who you want to punch in the face to get that stupid look off his face. The \"good guys\" are not much better. Starting with Pinkman and his unbelievably stupid actions and arguments with Walt that make absolutely no sense and seem to be put in there to make some sort of suspense between the characters. Although Hank is getting more interesting as the seasons go on, in the first 2 seasons though he was somewhat of a comic relief type with jokes that failed miserably. Now we have Saul replacing him, who's failing even worse. Skyler is just very annoying. Another thing to be seen across the reviews is good acting. I'm sorry I just don't see it, excluding Bryan Cranston/Walter White.

His metamorphosis from passive aggressive husband/father to hardcore meth God is the meat of the series. But everyone is excellent. My only complaint has been in the last season.

This drama is unusual because of the lack of melodrama and a sedate pace which gradually builds up to a climactic crescendo ; there are no emotional pyrotechnics, no over the top performances, just nuanced acting by the cast. Bryan Cranston handles all the subtle shades of his character's persona with a masterful adroitness. The writers must be lauded for writing a complex character like Walter White. This series has an inherent melancholy and its characters seem almost Shakespearean in their emotional spectrum. This series is also a window into the murky underworld of drugs and a cautionary tale about what happens when one gets mired in this world.

I never previously searched for stuff with him but love Malcolm in the Middle -- only Cranston could have played Hal. Likewise, I felt he really made the show for Br Ba, although alone it is a tremendous piece of work. By any definition Br Ba set a new standard for dramatic thrillers. There's still nothing like it. On a personal note, I give a thumbs down to any review calling it a comedy-drama. Though there may be some humor behind the idea of a science professor becoming involved with meth, with Pinkman's incompetence in very serious situations, or with Saul's persona the series itself is not meant to be funny, imo. I've watched the series a number of times and I'm just trying to understand what could be such a humorous thread as to call the series itself comedy. Unfortunately, there is no specifics in those reviews so I'm at a loss, but hoping those people will seek help with their depraved sense of humor. For me, it is a very gritty and profound story that shocks even the most worldly viewer just when you start to feel safe. In the trivia section (with lots of great tidbits), we learn that Gilligan had used Cranston in an episode of X Files where he played opposite of his comedic persona, and states Gilligan knew from there only Cranston could play Walter White. He also is quoted as saying he wanted White to go from a Mr. Chips type to Scarface. I actually was rooting for Heisenberg (a tribute to Werner Heisenberg, who formulated the uncertainty principle) and disliked the ending initially. But as Anthony Hopkins stated, Br Ba is so amazing it can be compared to a Shakespearean tragedy. I was also one of those who strongly dislike Skylar, played exquisitely by Anna Gunn. Not because she was a \"strong female lead\" as she once claimed was the reason so many disliked the character, but because she was -- probably very intentionally -- the main antagonist to our lead guy, Walter White. Another interesting note is that Showtime, TNT, and HBO all declined the series when it was pitched & FX picked it up but dropped it for the show Dirt (I bet they all regret that now). Truly a mind-bending series that introduced us all to the overthetop facial & verbal expressions/emotion that are now so predominate in every genre. If there was ever a spin-off worthy character from the series, you would think it'd be Saul, however for me that series was so detached from Br Ba that it was relegated to my \"maybe later\" list.

There are not enough words to describe all the feelings and thoughts which crossed my mind when I watched the brilliant performances by Bryan Cranston and Co. The script is very bold, but also true to real life. Vince Gilligan and his team have constructed an arc of episodes which present a modern tale of how an ordinary (or not?) person can break bad under dire circumstances. And how a man can win and lose everything in a short period of time. No matter how hard I try to judge the main character, he is always more true than ever - acting and reacting to the world he lives in. The blending of different personae in one man shows us the real face of the human nature. We all feel connected to this story namely because we relate ourselves directly to many of the aspects of the characters in it. And to be able to express the whole spectrum of human emotions is what defines us not only as viewers, but as people who are able to feel empathy, even to the worst kind of behavior. To me this main character and this story embodies the spirit of our century - accepting without regret what we think and do - with all the consequences brought by our decisions.

As Walt climbs the corporate ladder you can't help but admire his ability to negotiate, interpolate, and take each new level in stride.

It has a great plot, unbelievable acting, a ton of action, and some of the biggest bad-asses in TV history. It all starts with the great plot. It is a cool plot where it is so fun to find out whats going to happen next. Probably one of the most addicting shows ever. You can never get bored of breaking bad. You are going to never want to leave the TV. They take an innocent protagonist and turn him into the antagonist but at the same time you love him. It is cool to learn how awesome science can be. The acting is out of this world. I never in a million years thought the goofy Bryan Cranston could take on a serious role and play it better than i could imagine. I had only seen him on Malcolm in the Middle so when I saw him in the description I thought the show would be bad but i could have never been more wrong. Cranston acts out of this world. Aaron Paul shocked me so much. He did an even better job than Cranston. He puts so much emotion into the show. He plays his part perfectly, I could not imagine anyone else playing Jesse Pinkman. The action is out of this world. There are constantly explosions, gun shots, deaths, and much more throughout the show. It really adds great suspense to the show. I think Walter \"heisenberg\" White (Bryan Cranston) has taken on the role of the biggest bad-ass on TV. He has so many bad ass scenes. Ranging from cool lines to big explosions. Heisenberg has the intelligence of Michael Schofield (Wentworth Miller, Prison Break), he has the craziness of Jack Bauer (Keifer Sutherland, 24), and the pure awesomeness of Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson, Taken).

Even right now I look back to those awesome moments which make this TV show dig into your head and I say \"That was probably the picture perfect definition of a good TV show\". There were so many moments where my jaw just had to drop and my nails were gone. This show teached me that you can never run out of original ideas. I know many good TV shows that start in an engaging season and the next ones just can't live up to the previous. But this show improved by the moment. The actors are fantastic, specially Brian Cranston who is for me the most interesting and bad ass of them all. Aaron Paul and Dean Norris were the other two who stood out. Of course the others were terrific too, like Anna Gunn and RJ Mitte. The same goes to Aaron who makes his character, Jesse a deep and dynamic one. The actors also look like they are cool dudes to hang out with! The mood of the show is quite dark and realistic and sometimes even funny. The story also brings up many philosophies worth thinking about. You can't help but laugh in some scenes that are so messed up but the way that the director portrays them is very humorous. Vince Gilligan does an amazing job of mixing tension, emotion and laughter. Another thing, the soundtrack! Every song fits perfectly with the scene it's in. It pumps you up in such a way I hadn't experienced yet. Oh man, there are so many scenes I'd like to show you which include a bombastic song, but I want to make this spoiler free.

The story is just so rich and full of surprises that your eyes will be glued to the screen. I also like the in-your-face realism, one seldom thinks that some scenes are too theatrical, no, even the spectacular or very coincidental parts are written and shot in a way that makes you think, why not? and places you in the midst of the action. The masterful writing leads to erroneous details that a viewer well versed in chemistry or DEA work will find being easily forgiven for the plot's sake, it's not a documentary after all. It's great how the story focuses on all levels involved with the meth trade, including the street dealer, lab work, be it in an RV, a hidden superlab or using fumigated houses for concealment, the police, corrupt lawyers, money laundering, how families get destroyed, big corporate moneymaking, the violence of Mexican drug cartels etc. While some may argue that a weak point of BB is the fact that you have to watch it beginning-to-end to really understand what's going on, IMHO this just highlights the strong writing, trying to tie up as many loose ends as possible, having earlier mistakes come to haunt Walt in later episodes, and so forth. Hank is always just one step behind Walt by picking up clues from previous episodes that the audience can piece together easily. The suspense is the show's other strength, at numerous times Walt is so close to being found out and still escapes by luck or ingenuity. There's the whole cat-and-mouse game of living a double life, getting entangled in lies, hiding in plain sight that the viewer can piece together and eagerly wait for the characters to unwind. This also adds to the comedic value, a lot of which stems from the character's witty lines full of dark humor, and great acting, also from the supporting cast. Cranston rightly deserves his Emmys for an astonishingly wide and realistic portrayal of emotions. Saul Goodman is another great character, well acted by Odenkirk, hilarious but realistic, and the epitome of white-collar crime. I could go on and on about how the characters' lives entwine, how things very nearly go wrong, how many lives Walt ruins in his quest to satisfy his hurt pride. If the script was made into a novel it would be a bestseller. Add to this a variety of creative camera angles, beautiful scenes of the endless New Mexico skies and high desert ranges, and this is also a treat for the eyes. An absolute must-see. There is also a moral tone to the story, and we see very clearly the effects the drug trade has on all that are involved. Families get ruined, from the Pinkmans to the Whites to the numerous sad but realistic end users of Walt's drugs. The violence involved, the complete wreck that Walt becomes while everything is seemingly running well are also strong messages to the audience. While it's sad to see the show end next summer, even this speaks in its favor. Rather than milking a good brand until it becomes boring, like so many other TV series that started out great and then watered down, this masterpiece knows when to retire: when it's at the top.

Breaking Bad is a work of art, and is easily one of my two favorite dramas. The first season is absolutely mind blowing. Most shows start to drag on and run out of ideas, and start to really crap the bed. Breaking Bad seems to just get stronger through each season, the whole entire show runs on the literary technique of dramatic irony. Meaning the viewer knows something that the characters don't. I find the plot unbelievably creative and realistic. I am extremely excited for the fifth season coming out next summer, season four ended with a bang.

Bryan Cranston has finally been able to prove what a brilliant actor he is with the character of Walter White and the unbelievable journey through the downward spiral he has taken us, and in my opinion, what a joy it has been to sit shotgun to show creator Vince Gilligan's crazy vision of the most messed up midlife crisis I have ever seen. Each episode seems to always throw more fire into the flames as the journey becomes more dangerous by the minute. Mr White reminds me of a teacher I had in high school, someone I always expected lived a very boring and routine life, not ever any real danger to it. But after watching Walter whites journey so far, who knows, maybe my teacher was a me-th cook as well.", "review_date": "19 December 2011", "rating_value": "10"}, {"reviewer_name": "jjnoahjames", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur12165280/", "data-review-id": "rw2508236", "short_review": "\"Cook\" this barbecue on your T.V. set!", "full_review": "", "review_date": "25 October 2011", "rating_value": "10"}, {"reviewer_name": "danielloos618", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur13863340/", "data-review-id": "rw2501763", "short_review": "My new favorite show", "full_review": "This show is simply the most captivating series I have ever watched. For the the past several years Dexter has been the only show on TV that held my interest from week to week......until now! I watched the first 3 seasons in a matter of days. I have become totally invested in the main characters, and am amazed at the chemistry between the cast members. It's refreshing to finally see a show that allows Bryan Cranston to use his skills to full potential. The man is a superb actor. Needless to say, Walt (Cranston) is my favorite character on the show. Coming in at a close second is Dean Norris, as Hank. Once again, a tremendous acting job. His character, along with Bob Odenkirk's character, Saul Goodman, provide much of the comedy relief. Speaking of Bob Odenkirk, it's good to see him thriving in this role as the \"dirty lawyer\". At first Saul seems like a simple comedic character, but as the show progresses, different sides of Saul are revealed.

The show starts off at a low pace in the first season. Most people might get bored and never watch further. But that's where you need to have a little patience. The story takes a dive into \"keeping you glued\" phase after that. Initially, Walt seems to be a lovable character. All his actions seem justified. Anything and everything for a family. But you are in for a little surprise there, later in the series.According to me, Jesse Pinkman is the BEST character of the series. Top notch acting, perfect portrayal of such a role requires a lot. Many of you might hate the character Skyler White from midway of the 3rd season, but she was always right! Till the end of 4th season Walt does everything possible to save himself and his family from Gustavo fring, the primary villain until then. But from 5th season on wards, I started to develop a certain sense of hatred for Walt. I mean you cant do anything for the sake of family. Greed, ego, too much family oriented reasons may make you hate him. He did everything for family only, accepted, but the level to which he drops is just not right. When he poisons Brock, he gets Hank killed and adding to that he lies with a straight face. No guilt. No regret. But Bryan Cranston's act was amazing. He is the perfect guy for this role. While approaching the end of the show, I wished that Walt shouldn't live, but it seemed otherwise from earlier episodes of season 5, but when Walt dies at the end(it was actually unclear as they just show his body on the ground with camera zooming out, so i presumed he died) a sense of relief overwhelmed me! He deserved to die. Jesse Pinkman was the main protagonist throughout the series for me. It was a bummer he didn't get as much attention on his personal life in the show as much as Walt did.

It won't always be nice to the viewer, it won't let you breathe somehow, it will keep you waiting, it will break your heart and it will make viewers reflect on our long history of watching movies passively and criticize our neutrality. Breaking Bad is accessible to the average viewer but rewards the active watcher. The story is a Greek tragedy dressed with a modern coating, creating and slowly dehumanizing the \"protagonist\" Walter White into someone the viewer usually despises. This show is all about change and brings the audience for the ride where we visually and emotionally witness the change of Heisenberg. The cinematography is breathtaking and personal, the performances are jaw dropping and sincere and the story is a down to earth modern tragedy.

I adore this show! The show is about a chemistry teacher at a high school in Albuquerque, New Mexico, named Walter White who has lung cancer and needs money to support his family for when he dies. He sees how much money the meth industry promises and he decides to cook meth with an old student of his named Jesse. Walt soon realizes that the meth industry is not a walk in the park and he faces against a lot of villains, outside conflict, and family drama at home. Not only is the premise really smart and dark, but the actors are amazing, especially Bryan Cranston as Walter White. He kills it every time and he is both evil and sympathetic at the same time. The great thing about this show is that you never know how the characters are going to get out of the situations that they are put in. It keeps you on the edge of your seat. The drama is intense and filled with tension. Its not an action show, its an intense drama that has violent moments that may sometimes be kind of graphic for some viewers. Its not cringe- worthingly graphic like The Walking Dead, Game of Thrones, or Sons of Anarchy, but its still very effective. The episode plots are just great, and suspenseful. I can't really think of an episode that was bad or okay. There are some episodes that are kind of slow, but they are character development episodes that help advance the plot and keep the show moving forward. I will say that the first season is a little slow, but after episode 5, it picks up and gets more interesting and there are only 7 episodes in season 1. The cinematography is wonderful. This is what I am loving about TV shows that are on AMC, HBO, FX, Netflix, and Showtime; their shows look like movies. Its very cinematic and it has unforgettable moments that most Hollywood movies wish they had. Vince Gilligan is just a brilliant creator and writer who really made one of the best shows of all time. Everyone involved with this show did a fantastic job. I definitely recommend this show to whoever is interested. Its one of my favorite shows and I am glad I saw it.

I loved watching this show. I loved every episode, each one being unique and great in Its own way and there was never a dull episode. This was a special show, and I just can't say enough about it. Breaking Bad is mainly about high school chemistry teacher and meth manufacturer Walter White. Walt's character has so much depth to it. The writers really do a fantastic job at developing his and all of the other characters into some of the most memorable characters I've ever seen. Walter White is one of those rare characters that just stuck with me long after the show ended and is one of my favorite characters of all time. The actors who portray these people are tremendous, and I can't think of any cast member who gave a poor performance. Bryan Cranston as Walt was absolutely phenomenal. He did such a great job, and he deserves any and all praise he gets. I thought Aaron Paul was also one who stood out as Jesse Pinkman. And even though he was only in four episodes, I thought Raymond Cruz as Tuco was outstanding. Tuco's character was one of the best and most enjoyable to watch in my opinion. The way this show is filmed is also excellent. It looks like a well-made movie and there is some great cinematography present throughout the series. The music that they add in is spot-on. They pick the best music for every situation throughout every episode and every season. Probably the best thing about the show is the story. Every episode is fun to watch and the story is just so fascinating and captivating. They develop their characters so nicely and quickly that the show becomes great almost right away. This show has meaning behind it, and someone with an eye for detail can understand and see the little things that are added in. Like the show Mad Men, you really have to pay attention to catch everything, although Breaking Bad has more action to it than Mad Men. Overall, Breaking Bad is great, and it portrays itself in such an interesting and incredible way that one can't help but become addicted to the characters and scenarios. I would recommend this show to anyone mature enough to catch small details and doesn't mind watching despicable people who do despicable things. Breaking Bad was a special and thought-provoking show that will go down as one of my favorite things to have ever seen on screen, television or cinema.", "review_date": "19 March 2014", "rating_value": "10"}, {"reviewer_name": "niksim1", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur26363077/", "data-review-id": "rw2964687", "short_review": "The Best Show Ever", "full_review": "", "review_date": "20 February 2014", "rating_value": "10"}, {"reviewer_name": "shurtugalsc", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur36011886/", "data-review-id": "rw2953562", "short_review": "Mind Blowing", "full_review": "The show is astonishing, the actors are great and interpret their characters perfectly.

I was pretty skeptical how would I present this to my wife as she loves to watch TV shows but reading short summary for Braking Bad made me overly cushion in which particular way will I approach to her. And boy did we have a blast on a five season marathon of pure TV show drama at it best :) I must say character developing in braking bad is just about as good as real life can offer. And drama, scripting, directing, casting, acting, music, plot development, twits it offers, wits in decision making, heart breaking moments, and at the end all things breaking bad just makes perfect sense in a world of Walter White and his family. I got a say that Bryan Cranston did outstanding job, performing his guts out making viewers to soak in like water in a sponge. What he did whit a Walter White character is just enormously, gigantic piece of art acting and he deserves to be put in TV shows annals as one of the best character acting of all times. He molds and twists hes charisma to the point that you just cant do better then it is :) And there is Jesse Pinkman - this guy slowly grows on you like a weed in a yard and it sticks whit you all the way to the end - you just cant get rid of him as much as you try - Aaron Paul is outstanding Jesse Pinkman to say the least :) Skyler (Anna Gunn) is beautifully incorporated as Walts beloved wife and she also get the same massive character development as Walt did - all those hard decisions Walt makes trough his career reflects on her as much as crystal clear mirror reflects our on image making us look for what we really are. Of Course, a joyable comedian of the show - Hank Schrader (Dean Norris) will make you feel on a threshold when the right time comes. The main thing, and this is why so many of us are hooked on breaking bad, besides the story, is how well taught and amazingly brilliant all those characters came together to form a master piece, a classic that will dwell in our minds for years to come :) Im absolutely overly stunned about how good this TV show is/was, and because of that Braking Bad is a must for all TV junkies out there - so prepare yourself for a ride of the decade and open your heart for truly amazing drama that will bring all the right emotions in you in just about perfect time.

A Chemistry-genius, who is stuck in a dead end high school teacher job with a pregnant wife, Skylar, and a teenage son, Walt Jr, who has cerebral palsy. After he gets diagnosed with stage 3 lung cancer, Walter starts cooking the purest crystal meth in America with his partner Jesse Pinkman, Portrayed by Aaron Paul. Basically the whole plan that Vince Gilligan had for this show was to show a transformation from \"Mr Chips to Scarface\". It is the first time that a protagonist of a TV show has had such a drastic change from the beginning of the show to the end. Tony Soprano, Don Draper and Omar Little always stay the same person and never change which is why we are so interested in them. However Breaking Bad is all about change and transformation. Other than Walt, Jesse changes from a druggy man-child to a scarred man who has seen things that would even traumatize a gangster. Walt's DEA agent brother-in-law, Hank Schrader, also changes from a overweight joker who doesn't take his job seriously to one of the best investigators and bad-asses ever seen on television. Believe me half of the bad guys (Tuco, Salamanca twins) are killed by Hank in this show. Along with Walt, one of the best villains and characters I've ever seen is Gustavo Fring. There are many adversaries that Walt faces but none have ever been as dangerous as Gus Fring. A quiet force that likes to be well dressed and formal but is cold and calculating. The calmness that he had when he slit Victor's throat and blood sprayed across the room was truly disturbing. Then quietly taking a shower and cleaning himself up like there was nothing going on was truly frightening. Breaking Bad took the action that you normally see in blockbuster movies and made them better. The exploding non-meth scene with tuco, Walt running over the two drug dealers and, of course, the explosive death of Gus Fring and the final shootout with the Nazis were all shocking and amazing. Usually when I see TV shows or movies I think that that I can write better than what I see. I think anybody could have written a better finale for Dexter or have made the second season of The Walking Dead less boring. However Breaking Bad truly had some of the most flawless writing I have ever seen. Quite possibly only The Sopranos, The Wire and Game of Thrones have writing that is as good as Breaking Bad. In conclusion, Bryan Cranston truly deserves the awards and admiration he has received for his portrayal of Walter White AKA Heisenberg and Vince Gilligan truly made a masterpiece. The ending depicting the survival of Jesse and the death of Heisenberg was perfect and fitting. Breaking Bad is amazing!

The Salamanca twins and Gus really show what the drug world is like.\nSeason 4 is my 2nd favourite season of tv of all time.

It is completely and utterly implausible to believe that anyone similar Walter White could succeed as a meth chemist for even one season without being killed or caught within the 62 episodes the series has. But the tight, virtually seamless story, and the sympathetic relatable characters, who nearly all resonate with most watchers, allow you to willingly set aside any differences with plausibility (which, commonly, the show does not mind doing).\nFor the most part, all the seasons are very well put together, with each having some of the greatest episodes of any show I've ever seen. Though season 2, as it is, is pretty bad compared to most of the other seasons. Now don't quote me on this because when I say bad I mean Breaking Bad levels of bad, which compared to other TV series is much less of a considerable insult.\nLike most shows I recommend not watching this out of order; More then any other series, huge changes in plot, story and character arc take place so excruciatingly fast you are likely to be completely lost if you skip episodes.

The main actors of the show are Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul, and Anna Gunn. The show sets place in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Walter White (Bryan Cranston) is a high school chemistry teacher who all of a sudden started feeling sick. Walter's wife, Skyler (Anna Gunn), takes him to the doctors. They find out that Walter has stage 3 terminal lung cancer and is only given roughly two years to live. Walter decides that he wants to have a lot of money saved for his family after he passes. He knows that it will be hard for his wife since they have a teenager with cerebral palsy and another baby on the way. So Walter decides to join the drug business after seeing how much money can be made. He meets up with an ex student named Jesse (Aaron Paul). Jesse was a student that never showed up to class and was a typical bad student, but he knew his information about the drug business. Walter and Jesse start getting their meth business going, knowing that they are risking getting caught and their lives.\n After about a year or two of getting their business on the run, they have to deal with a huge drug cartel that is partially ran by a man named Gustavo Fring. At the same time, Walter White realizes that he can't be going under his own name, so he decides to go by Heisenberg. Walter's brother-in-law, Hank, is a part of the DEA, so he's the most worried about him finding out because he knows that he will tell his wife and he will go to prison. Eventually, Walter's wife, Skyler, finds out that he has all this money stored away and confronts him on how he got the money. He comes clean and tells her the truth, but makes sure that he doesn't tell Hank. Skyler ends up leaving Walter and taking the kids with her and completely ruins Walter's life. He doesn't even want to be a part of this business anymore because of how much it ruined his family. After a lot of talking and fighting, Walter and Skyler work on their marriage and deal with Walter being a part of the drug game. Jesse and Walter eventually get into a huge fight and part ways from each other and do their own parts with the drug business. After realizing that Jesse's life went bad and he was getting robbed constantly, Walter and Jesse join back together and start up their business again.\n Hank and the entire Albuquerque police are looking for the best meth maker around, \"Heisenberg\". There is some suspension going on because there are pictures all around and Hank notices that Heisenberg looks a lot like Walter. After years of investigating, The police realize that Walter was the one going under the name \"Heisenberg\" and they start chasing after him. Walter realizes that everyone is searching for him, So he has to completely leave his family and take himself off the map from everyone.\n This is one of the most recommended shows of all time because of how great the story is told and the way the actors make their characters seem so believable. Bryan Cranston is an award-winning actor who is one of the main reasons why this show has been so popular by the way he acts and the way he portrays his character. Vince Gilligan has created one of the greatest shows to ever be made. The plot of this show is unreal because he gets so into depth and wants to have back stories on people so the people watching have a better understanding of the show. On the Internet Movie Database (IMDB), with over a million people rating the show, it has a 9.5 out of 10 which is a very rare thing to happen with that many reviews. This show is a well deserved award winner and will forever be a show to be recommended.", "review_date": "2 May 2018", "rating_value": "10"}, {"reviewer_name": "camachoa-45783", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur87928115/", "data-review-id": "rw4151025", "short_review": "It's Awesome!!!", "full_review": "Breaking Bad is produced by Vince Gilligan. It's a drama crime show that is very well written and shows all different aspects of a great TV shows; it has the drama, tension, acting and the setting of the show. Gilligan has the setup and the writers of the show do a really good job at grabbing your attention right away from the pilot episode. His writing skills, the camera work and the acting of the characters are only some of the awesome work that has been put into this show.\n The excellent way that Gilligan writes, the way he keeps you on your toes because nothing is predictable he switches setting on what is happening so that you can't really imagine what is going to happen next. If we take a look at how the beginning of the show, it starts with Walter White who is played by Bryan Cranston he is driving around in a RV through the desert in underwear and a gas mask, why or how he got to that point you really don't have an idea. Gilligan includes flashbacks in his storyline which in my opinion are great because they aren't hard to follow when he switches back and forth between memories. For example a different TV show I watched before was 13 reason why which honestly had so many flashback that you got lost and didn't know what was what, if you were seeing a memory or if it was the present time.\nThe camera work throughout the show is incredible. When Walter is finding out about having cancer and the way the camera zooms in on him blurring out the background, to where the camera focus on the mustard stain the doctor has on his tie when he explained to Walter what he has and what he should expect. Prior to all of these how when Walter is feeling sick and the angles of the camera show him passing out during the job. The angles they use when he is in the ambulance are all great qualities of a well written and directed show. The angles that are given in the first 5 minutes of the show; the motion of the camera when he is driving the RV. How it shakes and it makes you feel like you're inside the car makes everything more believable.\n The acting that the whole cast has put into this show is incredible. The interactions between Jesse who is played by Aaron Paul and Walter is unbelievable. It truly feels like they are the characters in real life not that they are just acting. When Walters family is having breakfast and his son Walter Jr. (RJ Mitte) is sassing back the mom Skyler White (Anna Gunn) about the fake bacon that is made out of turkey not pork the way both characters get so comfortable together and get into the argument and they 100% function like a true family with a rebellious kid. \n Vince Gilligan drama crime show Breaking Bad is a masterpiece in my opinion the writing, camera work, and the acting and chemistry between the cast are all strong elements that you can't miss skills throughout the show.

I think (and most people will agree) that BB's Star-Cast takes this show to a new zenith. I don't think anyone in the acting area can replace Aaron Paul drug addicted , \"b**ches\" crying Jeese Pinkman or Dean Norris's Hank Schrader or Bob Odenkirk's Saul Goodman, the list goes on. But its Bryan Cranston Heisenberg that ultimately steals the show. His one liners, his monologues , his stares , his anger , everything is pitch perfect. A dying responsibility laden father or a drug kingpin , both roles are delivered by Cranston perfectly and smoothly. You may not love Mr Walter White , but you cannot hate the awesomely cool Heisenberg , you just cannot . And if you go through first couple of seasons , the rest are not just gems , they are pure 1000 carats of diamond . In short , if the painting world has Mona Lisa , the Music world has Beethovan's 9th Symphony , Baseball has Babe Ruth , Basketball has Michael Jordan , Cricket has Sachin Tendulkar , Football has Pele , Hollywood has The Godfather , then the TV definitely has BREAKING BAD .

Vince Gilligan has a masterpiece in every aspect with Breaking Bad. This show takes you through a story of Mr. White as he goes from Chemistry teacher to drug kingpin. How does such a simple teacher turn into one of the most insanely entertaining characters in TV history? Gilligan figured out how in the most profound way with Breaking Bad. Walter White gets diagnosed with cancer and teams up with local drug dealer and former student Jesse Pinkman. The duo seems unorthodox, but they make it work. Through the story, Walt has to deal with family problems, issues with other drug dealers, and the law. The story starts slower to develop the characters, but as everyone is introduced, the story picks up into one wild ride. This show has the best character development of any TV show that I have ever seen. Walter White goes from quiet teacher to the craziest anti-hero that has ever been imagined, and his parter Jesse Pinkman goes from a small time dealer to someone who just wants to survive. The challenges are larger than life and at times Jesse finds it all to be too much, much because of Mr. White himself. These two are a duo of a lifetime. Because of how fantastic this show is, there is no surprise that Breaking Bad has won countless awards and recognitions along the way.

I have never in my life seen a programme so incredible, after a few episodes you will be hooked. Like most people who have seen the 5 series Thriller, I finished all five in around 10 days or so. The Series is just so unique and original, it is remarkable how a show about a Meth-Dealing Cancer patient can impact someones life so much, the show is entertaining, comical, but yet can also teach the audience lessons on empathy, the overall five seasons focus on the downfall of Walt, how he begins as the lovable friendly family man who is severely overqualified for his work, and doesn't have much to show for his life, he uses his wasted intelligence in a get rich quick scheme, hoping to leave plenty of money for his children before his inevitable demise. The irony of the show is unbelievable, Walt on his pursuit to become the ultimate Drug-Lord, spends much of his time with his DEA brother-in-law, who is surprisingly oblivious that Walter could be involved in the case which he has spent the best years of his career chasing. Hank does come close on some occasions to exposing Walt, but Walt risks his life many times to keep his Drug Kingpin alter-ego hidden. Vince Gilligan is a phenomenal writer, and each episode appears to be even better then the previous, it takes a literary genius to leave almost every episode on a cliffhanger, making you crave more episodes. At the mid-season break in season 4, Gilligan even makes it seem like Walter could actually get away with the last year of his life, in which his drastic downfall occurs, the pushing-away of his wife, Skylar, as well as his cerebral palsy suffering son, Junior. The irony of how Hank realizes Walter is the 'Heisenberg' who he has been hunting for years, makes the audience sit on the edge of their seat, gagging for the next episode to come. Breaking bad is original, unique in it's time and honestly, one in a million. Even in the finale, it is amazing how the audience still has much empathy for Walt, despite his inner demons overtaking his good- nature.", "review_date": "17 May 2014", "rating_value": "10"}, {"reviewer_name": "montblanc555", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur52304235/", "data-review-id": "rw3015536", "short_review": "Addicted to Breaking Bad", "full_review": "Crime does pay or maybe not.

The suspense packed episodes overdose you and make you an addict yourself to the show. Acting is excellent and the entire cast does justice to their scripts. Most of the characters are so well developed that even the bad guys leave a lasting impression. If you want to watch a good series nothing gets better.

The chemistry between them it's perfect like all in this show. Anna Gunn, Dean Norris, Betsy Brandt, RJ Mitte, Bob Odenkirk, Giancarlo Esposito, Jonathan Banks, just everybody in the show is perfect for the roles they play.

Walt has a handicapped son a daughter in the way and his wife doesn't work. So clearly he needs the money.He is not a bad man he just makes bad decisions. But after a while Walt loses sight of whats really important and why really entered the business in the first place.Now as much as you can think there is nothing brilliant about this show , but you're really wrong,because the writers develop this story into one of the most complex storyline you have ever seen. Also what i mostly love about breaking bad is that there is no bad character in this show such as there is no bad actor.From Bryan Cranston(Walter white) to Aaron Paul (jesse pinkman) who made two of the best performances in TV history and making one on the best duos of all time.But not just them all actors even guest actors.And every time the season end with some spectacular event that leaves you really waiting the next season.

A fantastic drama series with touches of comedy. Bryan Cranston plays Chemistry teacher Walter White. He has a loving wife, a child with Cerebal Palsy and another is on the way.

Walter suddenly has a revelation, thanks to an idea handed to him by his brother-in-law Hank played by Dean Norris, who works with the DEA - he decides to become a crystal meth dealer.

Breaking Bad truly demonstrates how far a man will go for the well being for his family, as he goes through a life changing transformation. Vince Gilligan has managed to produce a very simple storyline yet very effective in both action and drama, as he presents a man near death and running out of options the only thing left to do, \"Break Bad\". Cranston's not the only star in the show there's also Aaron Paul who has not only won one, but two Emmy award for outstanding acting for his portrayal of young adult gone down the wrong road, is absolutely fabulous as it reflects to real life of many people who have gone down the same path, making the show more intense, Breaking bad was nominated for cinematography, as its season 4 demonstrated the power of special effects. The opener starts off with a great scene of two planes crashing into each other, which is masterfully crafted as not only did it look realistic but also tired in greatly with the storyline as it shows how destructive Walters(Bryan Cranston) life has become. Great cinematography is once again shown in the equally brilliant season 5. Walter (Bryan Cranston) demand the murder of 8 people, yes it may seem a bit harsh calling a murder great thing but with the help of Gilligan's great directing skills they are all shown in an impressive montage of flashes where we see each prisoner being killed in different ways. As I said before murder is harsh, but with the help of music it s and looks like a piece of artwork. In many shows music is mainly used to represent certain emotions for characters, however in breaking bad it is used to create a surprising sense of humor every time when we see the duo \"cooking a batch\", by doing so it make something so dangerous such as making drugs seem almost fun and harmless, as such jolly music accompanies it. Breaking bad is not all about action as hard as it sound, in fact it can be quiet poetic as each character is represented by the colors of there clothing for instance in the beginning of the series we see Walter wherein grey to represent the dullness in his life but as the show progressed it soon changed to black and blue which highlight the dangers in life as well as the excitement. Overall I believe that there is a lot of potential left for the shows which we will hopefully see in 2013 where it will continue the legacy of it presodecer seasons or hopefully surpass them in excitement and drama.

Bryan Cranston is truly amazing as the protagonist- initially an amiable, family orientated character, the story displays his change in personality- quickly becoming the most important asset in the meth trade. Cranston is the star of the show but he is supported by a superb cast. Fully deserved of all the accolades, awards and critical acclaim, this series will suck you in and spit you out.

Basically the show sees the story of high school chemistry teacher Walter \"Walt\" White (Golden Globe winning and three-time nominated, and four-time Emmy winning and twice nominated Bryan Cranston, also producing, and directing some episodes), he is diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer, and he wants to make sure his family is financially supported after he dies. Therefore, with former student Jesse Pinkman (Golden Globe nominated, and three-time Emmy winning and twice nominated Aaron Paul), having seen the opportunity to make thousands of dollars from it, Walter with his chemistry knowledge manages to cook a perfect batch of crystallised methamphetamine, coloured blue, so he produces it and Jesse finds methods to sell it. They start independently, cooking in an RV, selling to psychopathic Mexican drug kingpin Tuco Salamanca (Raymond Cruz), with Walter using the alias \"Heisenberg\", but he becomes too dangerous to do business with, so they find a way to dispose of him and move on. Walter and Jesse settle on business with Gustavo 'Gus' Fring (Emmy nominated Giancarlo Esposito), a respected man who owns many businesses, including fast food restaurant chain Los Pollos Hermanos (Spanish for \"The Chicken Brothers\"), he uses his businesses to secretly distribute crystal meth across America, he gives the pair their own lab, hidden beneath his laundry business. Walter tries to balance his life of crime while continuing to maintain his family life, with wife Skyler (twice Emmy winning and nominated Anna Gunn), who eventually finds out, but helps to hide the money and all from teenage cerebral palsy suffering son Walter \"Flynn\" White, Jr. (RJ Mitte) and the rest of the family. Meanwhile, Walter's brother-in- law Hank Schrader (Under the Dome's Dean Norris) is a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent trying the stop the selling and distributions of drugs across America, especially crystal meth, following the many clues he finds to find \"Heisenberg\", he is completely unaware (until near the end) that his own brother-in-law is responsible. To make certain that business continues to grow, and the DEA and other authorities do not discover Walter, Jesse and all others involved, Walter hires lawyer Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk) as their accomplice, he has connections to \"fixers\", and they also have his private investigator Mike Ehrmantraut (Emmy nominated Jonathan Banks), who also works for Gus, getting involved when needed. Throughout the series Walter struggles to keep his personal and \"professional\" life separate, with dangerous criminals and the authorities getting too close, Jesse struggles with his conscience in situations and to keep those he cares for safe, Hank gets obsessive about finding those spreading the blue crystal meth across the many states, and Skyler becomes understandably concerned for the safety of her family, as well as depressed and loathsome of Walter. In the end, after the deaths of Gus and Mike and much more going on, Walter's world crumbles when he is exposed for the drug criminal he is, Hank is killed, Jesse is forced to continue cooking by criminals, Walt goes into hiding for months with cancer before returning to see his family one last time and get revenge against the criminals who wronged him, Walt ends up mortally wounded and succumbs to his injury, dying as the police close in. Also starring Betsy Brandt as Marie Schrader, Steven Michael Quezada as Steven \"Gomie\" Gomez, Charles Baker as Skinny Pete, Jesse Plemons as Todd, Christopher Cousins as Ted Beneke, Laura Fraser as Lydia Rodarte- Quayle, Matt Jones as Badger, Michael Shamus Wiles as ASAC George Merkert, Lavell Crawford as Huell, Krysten Ritter as Jane Margolis, Carmen Serano as Carmen Molina, Emmy nominated Mark Margolis as H\u00e9ctor \"Tio\" Salamanca (the bell ringing wheelchair-bound silent former drug runner and enforcer, one of my favourite characters), David Costabile as Gale Boetticher, Michael Bowen as Uncle Jack and Robert Forster as Ed. Cranston gives a brilliant performance as the ordinary dying man turned ruthless drug maker, he's both the sympathetic and loathsome anti-hero, Paul is equally brilliant as the street-wise drug-taking young man who has an ever-changing personality and a conscience, supporting cast members Gunn and Norris and others give great performances as well. The show I admit started slightly slow, but you are certainly hooked, and by season 2 or 3 you are absolutely gripped and cannot stop watching, it has everything you could ask for: brilliant acting, writing and direction; it has danger, intrigue, small moments of comedy and much more, the best episodes I think are the TV break down in the middle of nowhere and in the lab trying to catch the fly, and of course I agree with critics and opinions that it has a fantastic ending, overall it is a a suitably acclaimed, unmissable and superb crime drama. It won the Golden Globe for Best Television Series - Drama, and it won the Primetime Emmys for Outstanding Drama Series (twice, also nominated three times), Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series (also nominated three times) and Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Drama Series (four times, also nominated five times), and it was nominated for Outstanding Cinematography for a One Hour Series (three times), Outstanding Cinematography for a Single-Camera Series (twice), Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series (five times), Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Drama Series, Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series (three times) and Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Comedy or Drama Series (One Hour) (twice).

I can say that with resolution. From the highly subtle and sensitive character development, to the outrageous and surprising twists and turns the plot takes, every scene is a necessity in the development of the story. No stone is left unturned. At no point do you feel like you want to scream \"why are you doing that?!\" and if you do, there is a definite and clear reason as to why the characters act in the way they do, often far more clever and calculated than any viewer could predict.\nIt is a carefully constructed combination of dry, dark humour and horrifyingly gory, depressing scenes, yet, beautifully paired with experimental cinematography, it manages to leave you constantly assessing and evaluating true morality. The plethora of particular camera angles, use of various filters, the brilliant soundtrack and the ambience of each scene is always somewhat upbeat, despite the many dire situations that the characters involve themselves with.\nHaving watched this series multiple times, I am truly never disappointed by a scene. Each scene is carefully constructed to lay bare the questions that we would ask within ourselves throughout different phases of our lives. Even, for example, the episode where Walt becomes obsessed with a fly - that is another very intricate yet important character building expression.\nVince Gilligan, Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul and Co truly capture an essence within our humanity that we ourselves cannot necessarily comprehend until we are exposed to empathissing with these emotional situations, through this series. Extremely accessible and relatable whilst also totally shocking in parts, it is a rollercoaster ride throughout, leaving you feeling simultaneously defeated yet very much empowered by the end.", "review_date": "18 September 2019", "rating_value": "10"}, {"reviewer_name": "avi-42883", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur106228775/", "data-review-id": "rw5094036", "short_review": "Very VERY well made!", "full_review": "The slow build up of story, wonderful acting, good direction, all combined made it very enjoyable to watch!", "review_date": "1 September 2019", "rating_value": "10"}, {"reviewer_name": "dft-14246", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur69016896/", "data-review-id": "rw5086901", "short_review": "The Best", "full_review": "The best tv show ever.

You can not help but be hooked and want to watch more and more and more and more. Aaron Paul is phenomenal as Jesse Pinkman, Pinkman is very, very dumb, but he is so lovable and despite being a drug dealer still stands up for what is right at times. The amazing thing about Jesse Pinkman is that he clearly he has a consciousness when it comes to killing people or ruining people's lives. He does not mind when they are drug dealers, but when they are good, normal people he cares and stands up for what he believes in. Cranston is amazing as suburban husband and teacher Walter White. The audience sees White morph from a wonderful, thoughtful husband into a cruel, callous drug lord. White becomes an entirely different person and even gives himself a new name for this new persona, but I will not spoil that. The writing is absolutely superb, the only bad episode that I can remember is called \"The Bug\". Breaking Bad may be the best show of all time, but that has to be one of the worst episodes in the history of tv shows. Please skip that episode, but otherwise it is absolutely amazing. I watched this show for the first time at a very young age and it definitely had an impact on me as to whom is involved in the drug world and erased any curiousness I had as to how drugs would make me feel. I suggest this for teenagers, adults, or anybody who wants to watch amazing television while discouraging drug use at the same time. Breaking Bad definitely does not glorify the world of drugs, it simply states what the drug world is like.

I've thrown up the spoiler tag because I don't even wanna hint at what this show is about if you haven't already seen it. If you want more of a critique and review of the show, keep reading! Breaking Bad is, and probably will remain the best television show I've ever seen. I could talk for days about just why this show is so damn good, but having watched the show through about half a dozen times now, I can articulate EXACTLY why its the best show around and why it probably will remain the best show around. Breaking Bad is CONSISTENT and HONEST with itself. It's a crime show, it's a drama, it's a pitch black comedy, but most importantly, it's a show about a guy, a guy who we know is gotta change, but just how far he's going to change, well... I guess we'll just have to watch. Chances are if you've watched a television show from 2010 on you've seen Breaking Bad. I say this because Breaking Bad really capitalized on character drama, specifically that of an anti-hero and a nefarious rise to power (turns out this was a market most networks didn't even think about). Vince Gilligan and crew had a mighty task ahead of them when crafting a show like this: \"If Walt's gonna become an evil guy, how are you gonna get folks to root for him?\" You make it honest. You cast an unlikely villain too. Often a subject of jokes in it's earlier seasons, everyone only knows of Bryan Cranston from the outlandish performance in Malcolm in the Middle. Try to remember that when you get to season 5. Breaking Bad doesn't paint an unrealistic portrait of a drug kingpin, but rather a man in a dance with fire praying to God that he doesn't get burned. Walt plays a dangerous game in this show, from his humble beginnings of \"just one cook\" to \"just this much money\" eventually get wrapped into \"we have to get rid of Tuco\" to \"we have to get rid of Gus\" to \"I'm in the empire business\". We stick with Walt all the way through because the show is honest with us. It's a slow burn to be sure but it's one that we believe, and more importantly, it's one that we trust. Looking back on the show I realize that to some degree, I was willing to let the poisoning of Brock slide simply because I wanted so badly for Walt to make it. That's good writing. That's good acting. That's INCREDIBLE pacing. The real surprise heart of the show is in fact in the side kick, Jesse Pinkman (hats off to Aaron Paul who really delivers in this show). If Walt's change is that to go from good to bad, Jesse's is much more focused on heartless to caring. I could speak volumes to Aaron Paul's performance here but I wanna focus back on the show as a whole: The title of this summary is Lightning in a Bottle. This show is consistent. You know from the first episode Walt has cancer. It's going to end, it's just a matter of time. I give this show a 10/10, but that does not mean it isn't without its flaws. I think season 3 is kind of a drag. It's good. I know why its there. It's all building for the eventual topping and emotional payoff of seasons 4 and 5. Unfortunately I'm an American, which means I can't go more than 60 seconds without a wink, nod, one liner, or an explosion to keep me invested (only kind of). I think Marie is just not that interesting a character. Early on she gets some attention, a problem that Hank often has to intervene, thus giving screen time, thus slowing down the pacing (something about stealing spoons in an open house tour just isn't as captivating as running a meth empire on Walt's end). Tuco's cousins are my least favorite part of the show. They're hinted at when Walt and Jesse are captured, a force from south of the border will come along and kill Walt and everyone he loves. They are intimidating... but at the same time... they're kind of comical. They're these \"silent badass\" dudes, hit men for the Cartel. They're given some depth but these clowns just feel laughably one dimensional. But they're important, they really affect the story. I guess I just wish they weren't crafted to be so stereotypical (at one point they even walk away from an explosion). But Breaking Bad is more than the sum of its parts. There is no perfect show, but this is damn near close. I cannot recommend Breaking Bad enough. It's a classical story, of a good man turned bad, but oh man is this show creative.

I think it demonstrates how ridiculous the war on drugs is, while showing in detail the devastation drugs can have on one's life. This show demonstrates that most of the problems resulting from drugs are created by criminalizing people for such victim-less crimes. The residual victimizing drugs create are as a result of the illegality of them. It shows the hypocrisy of many issues, such as alcohol prohibition. as to how one day they can be illegal and the next day be legal. The DEA's wife is committing an actual crime such as theft, but it's OK when your husbands a DEA. Just got into the show and I busted out the first 2 seasons in the last few days and I'm just now getting into the 3rd. I have to admit the show gets a little draining, because it seems to have way too many lows and not enough highs. The wife thing got really draining for me... if I wanted to deal with that crap I would have gotten married... instead I watch this show and I feel like I am. It's like I totally understand about the wife's frustration and all, but do I really need to deal with it every frickin episode!!! What were they thinking... that's not fun to watch, man! I really hope the writers figure that crap out before the end of the 3rd season. The constant nagging between Mr. White and Jessie get's tiring and draining as well (mostly created by Mr. White). It takes 2 full seasons before the show even goes into a potential caring or friendship between the two of them. You have Mr. White being a total ahole to Jessie all the time and Jessie always on the defense. 95% of there interactions is one of them screaming at the top of their lungs at the other one... not entertaining, not fun, not funny, just really draining! When he lit the money on fire, I was honestly about to stop watching the show, but luckily he had a change of heart, because that would have been the straw that broke the camels back for me and I'm sure a lot of other people as well. The neighbor chick dying was really sad... also bummed because she was soooo hot, now I'm left spanking to sage brush. Anywho I rate the show a 10 because it's better then most the crap out there, and I like the message the show is portraying.

No episode is slow paced and now there is some guaranteed action such as a shootout or fights. Unlike the first series where there was barely any action violence.

I can honestly say it's quite probably the most consistently excellent TV show I've ever seen, with the arguable exception of The Wire. Damn, but it's hard to call which is better, so I'm not going to.\nMost shows which have longevity really struggle to bring things to a close when their number is finally up, but the way Walter White ends his meth-cooking saga, on his own terms, is nothing short of genius.\nThere's really not much that could've been done to make Breaking Bad better, even with hindsight. The lead performances of Walt and Jesse are superb, and the majority of the supporting cast do solid work with sometimes slim material. If I was being uber critical I might suggest some of the lesser characters don't serve much purpose, but then again they're part of the wallpaper of life, as it were; no one lives in a vacuum, especially not meth-cooking master criminals. The dialogue is frequently fantastic, but not generally out of character, and the storyboarding is more than occasionally astoundingly good. Notable scenes are the mariachi tale of how much the Mexican cartels had come to hate Heisenberg, and the flashy intro to Walt's compulsive purchase of twin musclecars for him and his son. These flashes of humour throughout the series really lift the dramatic content too.\nIf you've never watched BB, but have ever wondered what all the fuss was about (like I did for 10 years), just buy the boxset and start binging.

While the show is very linear there are subplots they create and get rid of. The acting is 10/10 Emmy worthy, I love Malcolm in the Middle and all I can say is, wow. What a transformation. Cranston has always either captivated me or had me laughing in tears. Every character feels so necessary and needed to continue a great story. While Skylar can get annoying you can't help but feel for her. Walter Jr exaggerates his disease perfectly, and Jesse, ooh Jesse. This man sold me from the start that he would be amazing. Each character develops over time and I'd say he (a tad more than Walt) has the largest transformations. Before I watched Breaking Bad on Netflix I'd never seen any of these actors besides Cranston, and now I love all of em. Walt is a guy who you shouldn't root for but you do through the entire series, and when you don't believe me it's very short lived. Every action has a consequence, and the \"answer man\" as Mike says can either avoid them or fix them. From police to dealers to his partner. If you never seen this show and are hesitant to watch it.

A mixture of drama, suspense, psychological thriller, with the right pinch of comedy and action who makes you tense from the beginning to the end. Every new season is better than the previous and the series finale closes the story in a epic way. No wonder that Breaking Bad won so many awards, 63 at total in these 5 seasons. No wonder too, that even before the series ends, it was already considered cult. I highly recommend. I'm already missing Walt, Jesse, Saul, Gus, Mike, Hank, Albuquerque, Blue Crystal and everything about this series... Breaking bad it's not just a series. It is a work of art. \"I am the one who knocks\".", "review_date": "22 April 2014", "rating_value": "10"}, {"reviewer_name": "TyrantSlaughter", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur4460537/", "data-review-id": "rw3001304", "short_review": "Will be remembered as one of the best shows", "full_review": "", "review_date": "19 April 2014", "rating_value": "10"}, {"reviewer_name": "pete-murphy97", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur49380102/", "data-review-id": "rw2995174", "short_review": "Breaking standards for the better", "full_review": "", "review_date": "9 April 2014", "rating_value": "10"}, {"reviewer_name": "minipotus", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur51592876/", "data-review-id": "rw2995050", "short_review": "One of THE Best", "full_review": "Among the series I've watched so far, some faded away after a couple of seasons, became diluted and mainstream. But I say this one is unique in terms of story development. I feel it gets more and more exciting season after season. The dialog was short to the point that the story wants to convey without deliberation and with some everyday familiar context. Abundant use of specific techniques ranging from zooming scenes on small little things to fast forward scenes, also kind of serve as a theme of Breaking Bad. The best part of it is excellent character depiction. Every actor and actress was really good at the respective role and not just them, the screenplay writers make the scenes longer. I normally agree with filmmakers when they don't want to show excessive seconds every scene as it could derail the story. The downside is the audience is unrealistically crammed what the makers want to show with just dialogs. But in Breaking Bad, the scene may not cut after a character finished conversation and slammed the door but followed him a bit longer when he expressed his state of mind. So all in all, I recommend Breaking Bad 10/10.", "review_date": "9 April 2014", "rating_value": "10"}, {"reviewer_name": "john-970-147597", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur51955572/", "data-review-id": "rw2994917", "short_review": "Just watch It!", "full_review": "", "review_date": "9 April 2014", "rating_value": "10"}, {"reviewer_name": "augustine-zairemtluanga3", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur49584660/", "data-review-id": "rw2994126", "short_review": "great plot!great acting!!!", "full_review": "i give a 9 not a 10 simply because we need to hold our breaths for most part of the show..the lighter moments do not contain much wit and humor.The show pretty much reflects reality in terms of Walter's cancer,so you cannot experience immense joy or laughter watching that family..and his wife is also the type of person who's concerned with every little details of her husband's life and very curious when she feels the husband's hiding something..the plot is great,the storyline is great..but,you won't laugh or even smile much during the show even when it's a little bit slow..so prepare to acknowledge the reality what any serious sickness can do to you...", "review_date": "7 April 2014", "rating_value": "9"}, {"reviewer_name": "Qwertyfirebird", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur44115980/", "data-review-id": "rw2993984", "short_review": "Breaking Bad is by far the best TV show I have ever watched. some what spoilers", "full_review": "The character development of Walter White and Jesse Pinkman is just amazing the love and hate relationship between the two could be a show in of its self (altgough I cant see spinoffs being good for the Breaking Bad series).

Breaking Bad was often a great show and a great story to follow along with. It also boasted two incredible performances from Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul throughout. The evolution of the series and of those two characters is something special to watch. The show never quite reaches that next level for one gaping reason, and it's partly because of it's two leads... the shows supporting characters are for the most part boring and irrelevant. When I think of some of the best dramas ever (Justified, Lost, Fringe, Damages, The Wire) the big thing that they possess that Breaking Bad doesn't are relevant characters. It's a lot easier to take your story in lot's of different directions and have relevant sup-plots when they involve characters that grab your attention. Breaking Bad struggled to have that throughout, with key supporting characters Hank, Walt Jr.,Marie, or Skyler (ohhhhh Skyler :S ) providing the spark for any good sub-plots. One great supporting character is Saul, but mainly for his comic relief. Most of Breaking Bad's supporting character's are ones with only a season or two story arc like Gus, Mike, Jane and the Salamanca's.

I think is easier to believe shows based on fiction or fantasy like Game of thrones because a person can ignore realities and the range for the imagination is wider and anything goes, however in shows that imitate reality is much harder to write because the writers have limits and like I said before you cannot kill a character because that particular character could affect the rating of the show.

Bryan Cranston and Anna Gunn are pure gold.. his transformation to an uncontrollable monster, and her attempts at having to deal with all goes with it, is unquestionably remarkable work. There's really only a couple main characters in the entire show that are at all likable, the rest are drug-dealing criminals and low-life's, or damaged personalities. It was most disappointing to see the alluring Krysten Ritter.. bit.ly/15r7d1Z .. depart after so few episodes.. most fans would have truly liked to see her continue for another season or two. It was a loss for the show, having such a dynamic female character excised so quickly. Once she left, the only reason to stick with the series is to see how all plays out between Skyler and Walt. What is most at issue is the writing. The story just has numerous obvious and unbelievable elements that cannot be overlooked, although it appears most viewers are unabashedly willing to do so.

He got cancer and he starts making meth with Jesse Pinkman so that when he died he got enough money so his family can survive. It's first season is interesting. My favorite part was when Walter goes to Tuco because Tuco has taken his meth and beat Jesse. I enjoyed the first season. Second and Third season of Breaking Bad is too slow. I get bored watching these episodes. After Hank, Walter's brother-in-law shot Tuco, it get pretty much depressing. Meanwhile, Walter start business with Gustavo Fring who's having very vast meth business. It's get interesting in very end of third season. Fourth and Last Season of Breaking Bad is very interesting. How Walter White take out revenge on Gustavo Fring? How Gustavo killed his old enemy? After killing Gustavo, Walter become king of meth empire. When Hank knows about Walter White in second half of last season, he tries to take down Walter with Jesse Pinkman. Unfortunately Hank was killed by gang who before works for Walter White. They take all of the Walter's money(about 80 million$) and take Jesse as a prisoner. They tortured Jesse and forces him to make meth for them. Here, everyone knows about Walter and his business. Walter decides to came back when Elliot and Gretchen said about Walter White on TV. Walter asks them to gave money to his son on his 18th birthday. In the end, he killed everyone who was with him in meth business, except Jesse and Saul Goodman. He asks Jesse to ran away as he himself get shot. A little disappointment for me is Jesse should also be killed. Some of the dialogs of Breaking Bad are becomes famous like, \"I am not in danger, I am the danger\", \" I am the on who knocks\", \" Let's say I know a man, who knows a man, who knows another man who can get through your work\".

For my liking it's one of my favorite shows ever but I would have never expected it to have such an amazing rating. 8.5 IMDb rating sure but 9.4 is surprising. There are way too many filler episodes that build up for some epic craziness in the episodes following so you have to get through them. Also, I would have thought the acting, which I think is amazing, would hurt the shows rating. The actors play the characters so realistically that it might be mistaken for bad acting, especially Bryant Cranston playing Walter White. In real life, people in tough situations people tend to struggle with decision making. I believe that people who don't like this show, which I thought would be a greater number, don't understand that we are watching the characters from 3rd perspective. For us observing the events, it seems so obvious to how the characters should react, but put yourself in one of the characters shoes, lets say Walter's wife Skylar, and you would react SO SO similarly to how she did/does. The story line progresses so much throughout the seasons that it's hard to believe where it started. The build up to the main episodes is so great that it gets pretty predictable to what is the big thing that is suppose to happen but these main events are so crazy that even when we know what's going to happen, they are still surprising.

That said, I must ask \"why the hell couldn't they get a native Spanish speaker to play the part of Gustavo Fring?\" It is more than apparent that first, he is not a native Spanish speaker, and second, in no way resembles or speaks like a Chilean. I mean, c'mon - some 16% of the population of the U.S. is Hispanic, and in the huge pool of people they couldn't find a good or even great native Spanish- speaking actor, maybe even a Chilean? Even the main chemist in the lab in Mexico did not appear to be Mexican. To name just a few candidates for the Gustavo Fring part known in the U.S.: Edward James Olmos, Jimmy Smits, Andy Garcia, Benicio del Toro, Hector Elizondo, Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, Raul Julia, etc. Probably any of these very fine actors could have been coached to have a convincing Chilean accent. H\u00e9ctor Noguera, one of the many fine Chilean actors, could have done the part without breaking a sweat. This is without considering that the character may or may not really have been Chilean, but that's another discussion, and in any case, he was SUPPOSED to have been Chilean, so he could at least speak like one. None of this is to disparage Giancarlo Esposito's work, which wasn't bad, although he only seemed to have a few facial expressions.

I am a bit late to review this title but I started watching it just about last month and it is so addictive that it has had me hooked onto it until I craved for more... Breaking Bad is a journey of a certain Walter White, an underachieving man, a man way too qualified for the job he does, the wages he earns, a man barely able to provide for his family which he loves more than himself is left with no option when he understands that he has cancer and little time on his hands; to choose the path that seems impossible for him- a timid, meek guy....a path were red is shed for green...lives are put at risk on a daily basis. He takes on the role of a manufacturer of crystal meth along with Jesse Pinkman a former student of his, who is a small time drug dealer! And he chose to break bad!!

The writing is simply incredible. When I first started watching this show I was hesitant because I typically don't watch shows like this. (I prefer, SNL, 30 rock etc) But when my cousin told me to watch it, after at least 3 episodes I got hooked! The plot is extremely intense, and super suspenseful. Bryan Cranston is an amazing actor, the character he plays is extremely complex due to learning he has lung cancer in the pilot, then later hiding a secret life of cooking meth from his pregnant wife. As someone who only knew him as 'the dad from Malcom in the Middle' he is so much more then that! His performance in this show, its truly phenomenal, in every way. There's a little bit of humor throughout the series as well, which lightens the hectic plot. I'd say the only downside is that, there aren't that many episodes, the seasons aren't your typical 20-25 episode seasons. I wouldn't suggest this show for younger audiences, because there is a solid amount of cursing, constant discussion of drugs, a little blood and guts and some sex.

The premise of the season sees Walter White and Jesse Pinkerman attempting to avoid the DEA and deal with their crazy kingpin Tuco. Bryan Cranston continues as Walter White and he is amazing in this role, he combines the toughness and loveable family man very well and provides such a powerful performance as an anti-hero. Aaron Paul is back as Jesse and his character has a really tough time during the season, he goes through probably just as much or even more then Walter does this season and it makes you really care about his character and their relationship. The supporting cast also all do a great job, Krysten Ritter from Jessica Jones plays Jesse's girlfriend on this show and she does a very good job in her role and it is interesting to see how her character affects the overall arc of the story. I thought Hank was one of my favourite characters of the first season but he is given a lot more depth this season and he is an even better character this season. Also shoutout to the character of Saul Goodman who added so much charisma to this show. The story is really interesting especially for the first few episodes, you have no idea what is going to happen and the intrigue is huge to see what is going to happen to the main characters. However, I felt during the middle of the season it slowed down and wasn't anywhere as interesting before picking up for the finale but the pacing of the season wasn't as strong. The script is fantastic with a great blend of real drama with the appropriate use of humour to truly humanise the people and make them feel as realistic as they can. The style is great, it makes the drug dealing business seem glamourous and gritty at the same time and it keeps you more interested throughout.

To support Skyler, his pregnant wife, and Walt Junior, his disabled son, he has to work twice. His already gloomy life becomes downright black when he learns that he has an incurable lung cancer. Doctors do not give him more than two years to live. To quickly raise a lot of money to protect his family, Walter sees only one solution: to use his knowledge of chemistry to make and sell crystal meth, a synthetic drug that pays a lot. He affers Jesse, one of his former students who has become a small second-clss dealer, to team up with him. The improvised duo set up a traveling lab in an old motorhome. This unexpected association will lead them into a series of adventures both comical and pathetic. What i like in this series is that there are a lot of adventures and that a lot of things happen to the main actor (the chemist), sometimes it's surprising, sad, funny, and sometimes even horrible, it is the mix of emotions that can be felt in this series that i love the most.

Things really hits the fan in the second half. The cast is great with well developed characters, although I still find Skyler annoying. They managed to make Walter White, who is a complete evil nutcase in my opinion, someone I actually rooted for. My only problem with the show is that big character revelations weren't done as well as it'd hoped due to all the build up. Like they'll not show the first time they learn something and just skip to the end of middle of that conversation/ revelation. Which was quite jarring as I would of preferred to see the instant reaction (although would be more difficult to write and act I'm sure). I also noticed a probably excessive amount of montages lol In season 5, which was probably due to an increased budget tbh but still it was quite a shift in editing style.

The premise itself is plausible. A chemistry teacher finds out he has inoperable lung cancer and begins a new career creating methamphetamine with the help of one of his former students. The residual effects on the lives of both are profound. Every human experience is explored along the way. Love, greed, murder, betrayal, and, ultimately, fate. But what I like best about Breaking Bad are the nuances. Walter holds a drug dealer captive. When Walter brings him a sandwich, the dealer removes the edges of the bread. In a later episode, Walter begins to cut off the edges of his own sandwiches. The message: even your enemies can make a point.

But it was a good experience, the way the series captivates us, watching the growth of Jesse and the transformation of Walter, it was soo amazing to see!\nMany people had recommended me to see this series and I've never seen much interest until finally coming here to IMDb and seeing the trailer and realizing that it was a very good series. I gave it to me to pass from a person who thought that it was more a series like the others to idolize both Walter and Jesse for being phenomenal personages.\nI regret the fact that this series isn't rated best here because it deserves a 10. For all the good representation by the characters and the way it was edited and performed, what quality! This series will be one of those that will see and review and recommend to all who wanted to see something with excellent content and as well represented as Breaking Bad. \nSo, I recommend you to see if you have not seen it, because you are missing one of the best things ever done in the world of cinema.

His relationship with Heisenberg, how he always felt that he was being used, like he was just a pawn, a means to an end is reinforced throughout the series, and when he finally gets out, the feeling is of liberation, in part quite literally. The relationship between the two is the high point of the series, how Walter considers him to be his son and goes to great lengths to protect him, time and again. His portrayal of transformation of a teacher to a drug lord is praiseworthy. As the series progressed his motivations are shown to change which is true for most people and hence is a very relatable character. The acting of his wife is also good, however I feel that time and again, she was shown in the wrong light. The series is made great by the acting of these three. Honorable mentions include Gus. The plot develops in such a way that the stakes increase every time. However, by the end of the season four you have a fairly good idea about what comes next. Even then the events play out in such a way that they keep you at the edge of your seat.

I have to give it up for Bryan Cranston. He is one of the best actors living right now. He was born to act. I mean his face just has so much emotion in it. Most actors have to try and get the right facial expressions to play that character right. But Bryan's face can make a wide range of expressions without even having to do much. And oh my goodness... Aaron Paul... When I first saw this show, he didn't seem like such a good actor. To me at least he didn't. But as the show goes on, his acting becomes phenomenal! Like when he gets mad in the show, it makes you think that he's in full rage in real life. It's truly amazing. Everyone did an amazing job on Breaking Bad.

The Sorpranos were East Coast gangsters Breaking Bad, Western gangsters but still both stories were captivating in there own way. I've seen every episode of both of these series and I vote Breaking Bad a winner by a nose. Perhaps its because Breaking Bad had little nudity, sex and graphic swearing. HBO did Sopranos and A&E did Breaking Bad which is likely the reason in the differences in sex, etc. HBO has also done the Game of Thrones and its very similar in sex, etc. etc. to Sopranos but still GOT is an excellent series and well worth watching. I'm only halfway through the second season of GOT but have liked it so much I've done a review of it and gave it a 9.

Every girl, show, movie, book, etc. I can always find a flaw with anything especially TV shows and movies other people think are amazing. But I must admit breaking bad is the most amazing TV show; from the acting, plot, writing, directing, and cinematography it is dare I say: perfect! Highly recommend if your a fan of dark comedies, or good filmmaking in general. I didn't think shows could get much better than \"the wire\" or \"it's always sunny in Philadelphia\". It's even up there, or perhaps better than, such films as \"pulp fiction\" and \"the shawshank redemption\". Anyway enough complimenting this show, lord knows it has enough recognition it doesn't need me to say anything. But I will leave you with this thought, every other show I have seen in the past, when I found out it was getting canceled I was relieved since most shows have run their course by this time so I want to see how it is closed out and say goodbye for good. Not only did I not want breaking bad to be canceled but I felt it was getting better every season and needed a few more seasons to do it justice. On the bright side is you won't get bored and begging for the end, you will be begging for Vince Gilligan so release the missing seasons in the future sometimes. So if you are an intelligent, open-minded person who appreciate good television and is sick of the other 95% of mindless garbage that ruins TV, \"Breaking Bad\" is the show for you! If you watch this show and do not like it, please email me, I am curious to see what the reason is since I have never met someone who has seen the show and not loved it. Possible reasons you won't love breaking bad: 1) Your idea of a great show is \"here comes honey boo-boo\" or \"lizard lick towing\", I'm which case there is no hope for you anyway so do not waste your time filling your head with any form of intelligent programming. 2) You are a recovering meth-addict and the sight or name \"meth\" sends your life into a downward spiral where your selling your body for 5$. In which case I understand and wouldn't recommend this show, i would recommend counseling. 3) You are a hipster douschebag so the thought of liking something that everyone likes drives you crazy. So now you need to prove how much of an individual you are and go against the grain so enjoying this show would be like \"being a sheep\" or something like that. So instead of watching this show smoke your electronic cigarette indoors so people can say \"sir you can't smoke in here\", and you can promptly reply \"how it's not a real cigarette it is water vapor\" \"I only smoke it to get attention it's not harmful to anyone's physical health, only mental health. 4) And last reason you won't love breaking bad: you died and now your a ghost and can't change the channel to put it on cuz the dumb-ass human you are haunting continues to watch a marathon of \"hard-core pawn\" while chain-smoking crystal meth and e-cigs.", "review_date": "22 April 2014", "rating_value": "10"}, {"reviewer_name": "paulhunt87-953-487714", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur51492700/", "data-review-id": "rw3002752", "short_review": "A CRYSTAL clear depiction of what a series should be!", "full_review": "", "review_date": "22 April 2014", "rating_value": "10"}]}, {"ImdbId": "tt0903747", "reviews": [{"reviewer_name": "FlakzRivera", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur34542964/", "data-review-id": "rw3001886", "short_review": "Series about how a good person can fall to the darkside and lose everything", "full_review": "", "review_date": "20 April 2014", "rating_value": "9"}, {"reviewer_name": "Geeky Randy", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur0756238/", "data-review-id": "rw2950384", "short_review": "Geeky Randy's summary", "full_review": "", "review_date": "27 January 2014", "rating_value": "9"}, {"reviewer_name": "Pooledogg", "reviewer_url": "/user/ur7906142/", "data-review-id": "rw2948713", "short_review": "Number 3 for me", "full_review": "This is a fantastic series and if you give it 3 episodes you'll be addicted.
